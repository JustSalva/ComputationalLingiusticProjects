<PROPER_NOUN> questioned D'Artagnan by a look .
He answered in the same language .
`` Proceed , '' she said .
Comminges returned to his post .
An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through .
Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister .
`` <UNK> ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> , in a loud voice .
`` <UNK> ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> .
But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out , all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it <UNK> simultaneously .
Cries of `` Down with <PROPER_NOUN> ! ''
`` Death to the cardinal ! ''
resounded on all sides .
At the same time through the streets of <PROPER_NOUN> , <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , and <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of <PROPER_NOUN> 's horse and that of <PROPER_NOUN> .
This new <UNK> was more dangerous than the others , being composed of armed men .
It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the <UNK> at the same spot , but a concerted organized attack .
Each of these <UNK> was led by a chief , <NUMBER> of whom appeared to belong , not to the people , but to the honorable <UNK> of mendicants , and the other , notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people , might easily be discerned to be a gentleman .
Both were evidently <UNK> by the same impulse .
There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage .
<UNK> of hoarse cries , forming <NUMBER> vast <UNK> , were heard , mingled with guns firing .
`` <PROPER_NOUN> !
Musketeers ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> .
The escort divided into <NUMBER> <UNK> .
<NUMBER> of them passed around to the right of the carriage , the other to the left .
<NUMBER> went to support <PROPER_NOUN> , the other <PROPER_NOUN> .
Then came a skirmish , the more terrible because it had no definite object ; the more melancholy , because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting .
Like all popular movements , the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable .
The musketeers , few in number , not being able , in the midst of this crowd , to make their horses wheel around , began to give way .
<PROPER_NOUN> offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage , but the young king stretched out his arm , saying : `` No , sir !
I wish to see everything . ''
`` If your majesty wishes to look out - well , then , look ! ''
replied <PROPER_NOUN> .
And turning with that fury which made him so formidable , he rushed toward the chief of the <UNK> , a man who , with a huge sword in his hand , was trying to <UNK> a passage to the coach door through the musketeers .
`` Make room ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` <PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL> !
give way ! ''
At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head , but it was too late .
The blow was <UNK> by D'Artagnan ; the rapier had pierced his bosom .
`` Ah !
confound it ! ''
cried the <PROPER_NOUN> , trying in vain , too late , to retract the thrust .
`` What the <PROPER_NOUN> are you doing here , count ? ''
`` <UNK> my destiny , '' replied <PROPER_NOUN> , falling on <NUMBER> knee .
`` I have already got up again after <NUMBER> <UNK> from you , I shall never rise after this fourth . ''
`` Count ! ''
said <PROPER_NOUN> , with some degree of emotion , `` I struck without knowing that it was you .
I am sorry , if you die , that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me . ''
<PROPER_NOUN> extended his hand to <PROPER_NOUN> , who took it .
The count wished to speak , but a <UNK> of blood stifled him .
He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired .
`` <UNK> , people ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> , `` your leader is dead ; you have no longer any business here . ''
Indeed , as if <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> had been the very soul of the attack , the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall .
<PROPER_NOUN> charged , with a party of musketeers , up the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke , <UNK> near the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> and taking the direction of the quays .
<PROPER_NOUN> returned to help <PROPER_NOUN> , if <PROPER_NOUN> needed help ; but <PROPER_NOUN> , for his part , had done his work as conscientiously as D'Artagnan .
The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right , and they drew up the blind of the window which <PROPER_NOUN> , less heroic than the king , had taken the precaution to lower .
Porthos looked very melancholy .
`` What a <PROPER_NOUN> of a face you have , <PROPER_NOUN> !
and what a strange air for a <UNK> ! ''
`` But you , '' answered <PROPER_NOUN> , `` seem to me agitated . ''
`` There 's a reason !
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL> !
I have just killed an old friend . ''
`` Indeed ! ''
replied <PROPER_NOUN> , `` who ? ''
`` That poor Count de <PROPER_NOUN> . ''
`` Well !
exactly like me !
I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me .
<UNK> , I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood . ''
`` And he said nothing as he died ? ''
`` Yes ; he exclaimed , ` Oh ! ' ''
`` I suppose , '' answered <PROPER_NOUN> , laughing , `` if he only said that , it did not enlighten you much . ''
`` Well , sir ! ''
cried the queen .
`` <PROPER_NOUN> , the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road . ''
In fact , the procession arrived , in safety at <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , at the front gate of which all the <UNK> , with the coadjutor at their head , awaited the king , the queen and the minister , for whose happy return they <UNK> a <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> .
As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement , ran to the <UNK> , dressed himself quickly in the choir robes , and cleaving , thanks to that uniform , the crowd that filled the temple , approached <PROPER_NOUN> , who , clad in his blue robe , was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir .
<PROPER_NOUN> felt some <NUMBER> pulling his sleeve .
He lowered to earth his eyes , <UNK> raised to <PROPER_NOUN> , and recognized <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` Well , you rascal , what is it ?
How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions ? ''
asked the beadle .
`` <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> - you know who he is , he gives holy water at <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> - - '' `` Well , go on . ''
`` Well , he received in the <UNK> a sword stroke on the head .
That great giant who was there gave it to him . ''
`` In that case , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` he must be pretty sick . ''
`` So sick that he is dying , and he wants to confess to the coadjutor , who , they say , has power to remit great sins . ''
`` And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him ? ''
`` To be sure ; the coadjutor has promised . ''
`` Who told you that ? ''
`` <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> himself . ''
`` You have seen him , then ? ''
`` Certainly ; I was there when he fell . ''
`` What were you doing there ? ''
`` I was shouting , ` Down with <PROPER_NOUN> ! '
` Death to the cardinal ! '
` The Italian to the gallows ! '
Is n't that what you would have me shout ? ''
`` Be quiet , you rascal ! ''
said <PROPER_NOUN> , looking uneasily around .
`` So that he told me , that poor <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , ` Go find the coadjutor , <PROPER_NOUN> , and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir . '
Say , then , <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> - the heir of <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> , the <UNK> of holy water at <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> !
Hey !
I shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms !
All the same , I should like to do him that service - what do you say to it ? ''
`` I will tell the coadjutor , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> .
In fact , he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him <UNK> a few words , to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign .
He then returned with the same slow step and said : `` Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient .
<PROPER_NOUN> will be with him in an hour . ''
`` Good ! ''
said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` my fortune is made . ''
`` By the way , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` where was he carried ? ''
`` To the tower <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> ; '' and delighted with the success of his embassy , <PROPER_NOUN> started off at the top of his speed .
When the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> was over , the coadjutor , without stopping to change his <UNK> dress , took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well .
He arrived in time .
Though sinking from moment to moment , the wounded man was not yet dead .
The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering .
A moment later <PROPER_NOUN> went out , carrying in his hand a large leather bag ; he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold .
The mendicant had kept his word and made <PROPER_NOUN> his heir .
`` Ah !
<PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> , <UNK> ; `` ah !
<PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> ! ''
He could say no more ; but though he had n't strength to speak he had enough for action .
He rushed headlong to the street , and like the Greek from <PROPER_NOUN> who fell in the square at <PROPER_NOUN> , with his <UNK> in his hand , <PROPER_NOUN> reached <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> 's threshold , and then fell exhausted , <UNK> on the floor the louis <UNK> by his leather bag .
<PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> began by picking up the louis ; then she picked up <PROPER_NOUN> .
In the meantime the cortege returned to the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` That <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> is a very brave man , mother , '' said the young king .
`` Yes , my son ; and he rendered very important services to your father .
<UNK> him kindly , therefore , in the future . ''
`` <PROPER_NOUN> , '' said the young king to <PROPER_NOUN> , on descending from the carriage , `` the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to-day - you and your friend the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> . ''
That was a great honor for <PROPER_NOUN> and for <PROPER_NOUN> .
<PROPER_NOUN> was delighted ; and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied .
`` What was the matter with you , baron ? ''
<PROPER_NOUN> said to him as they descended the staircase of the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` You seemed at dinner to be anxious about something . ''
`` I was trying , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have killed . ''
`` And you could n't remember ? ''
`` No . ''
`` Well , search , my friend , search ; and when you have found , you will tell me , will you not ? ''
`` <PROPER_NOUN> ! ''
said <PROPER_NOUN> .
On going home , the <NUMBER> friends found a letter from <PROPER_NOUN> , who desired them to meet him at the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> on the following day .
The friends went to bed early , but neither of them slept .
When we arrive at the summit of our wishes , success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes .
The next day at the appointed hour they went to see <PROPER_NOUN> and found him and <PROPER_NOUN> in traveling costume .
`` What ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> , `` are we all going away , then ?
I , so , have made my preparations this morning . ''
`` Oh , heavens !
yes , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` There 's nothing to do in <PROPER_NOUN> now there 's no <UNK> .
The <PROPER_NOUN> de <PROPER_NOUN> has invited me to pass a few days in <PROPER_NOUN> , and has deputed me , while her son is being <UNK> , to go and prepare her residence at <PROPER_NOUN> ; after which , if nothing new occurs , I shall go and bury myself in my convent at <PROPER_NOUN> . ''
`` And I , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` am returning to <PROPER_NOUN> .
You know , dear <PROPER_NOUN> , I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman .
<PROPER_NOUN> has no fortune other than I possess , poor child !
and I must take care of it for him , since I only lend him my name . ''
`` And <PROPER_NOUN> - what shall you do with him ? ''
`` I leave him with you , my friend .
<PROPER_NOUN> has broken out in <PROPER_NOUN> .
You shall take him with you there .
I am afraid that remaining at <PROPER_NOUN> would be dangerous to his youthful mind .
Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself . ''
`` Then , '' replied <PROPER_NOUN> , `` though I shall not have you , <PROPER_NOUN> , at all events I shall have that dear <UNK> head by me ; and though he 's but a boy , yet , since your soul lives again in him , dear <PROPER_NOUN> , I shall always fancy that you are near me , <UNK> and encouraging me . ''
The <NUMBER> friends embraced with tears in their eyes .
Then they departed , without knowing whether they would ever see each other again .
<PROPER_NOUN> returned to the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> with <PROPER_NOUN> , still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed .
On arriving at the <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> they found the baron 's equipage all really and <PROPER_NOUN> on his saddle .
`` Come , <PROPER_NOUN> , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` bid adieu to your sword and go with me to <PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL> , to <PROPER_NOUN> , or to <PROPER_NOUN> <PROPER_NOUN> .
We will grow old together and talk of our companions . ''
`` No ! ''
replied <PROPER_NOUN> , `` deuce take it , the campaign is going to begin ; I wish to be there , I expect to get something by it . ''
`` What do you expect to get ? ''
`` Why , I expect to be made <PROPER_NOUN> of <PROPER_NOUN> ! ''
`` Ha !
ha ! ''
cried <PROPER_NOUN> , who was not completely taken in by <PROPER_NOUN> 's <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` Come my brother , go with me , '' added <PROPER_NOUN> , `` and I will see that you are made a duke ! ''
`` No , '' answered <PROPER_NOUN> , `` <PROPER_NOUN> has no desire to fight ; besides , they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony , which will kill my neighbors with envy . ''
`` To that I can say nothing , '' returned <PROPER_NOUN> , who knew the vanity of the new baron .
`` Then , here 's to our next merry meeting ! ''
`` <PROPER_NOUN> , dear captain , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> , `` I shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony . ''
`` Yes , yes , when the campaign is over , '' replied the <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` His honor 's equipage is waiting , '' said <PROPER_NOUN> .
The <NUMBER> friends , after a cordial pressure of the hands , separated .
<PROPER_NOUN> was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze , when the baron , after walking scarcely more than <NUMBER> paces , returned - stood still - struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed : `` I recollect ! ''
`` What ? ''
inquired <PROPER_NOUN> .
`` Who the beggar was that I killed . ''
`` Ah !
indeed !
and who was he ? '' ''
'T was that low fellow , <PROPER_NOUN> . ''
And <PROPER_NOUN> , enchanted at having relieved his mind , rejoined <PROPER_NOUN> and they disappeared around an angle of the street .
<PROPER_NOUN> stood for an instant , mute , pensive and motionless ; then , as he went in , he saw the fair <PROPER_NOUN> , his hostess , standing on the threshold .
`` <PROPER_NOUN> , '' said the <PROPER_NOUN> , `` give me your apartment on the first floor ; now that I am a captain in the royal musketeers I must make an appearance ; nevertheless , reserve my old room on the fifth story for me ; <NUMBER> never knows what may happen . ''
