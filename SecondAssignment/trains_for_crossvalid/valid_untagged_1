the

the
capital
of
the

was
swelling
in
all

with
a
black

stream

with

The

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore

had
to
strive
against
a
double
difficulty
,
-
against
the
force

national
antipathy
,
and
,
besides
,
against
the
feeling
of
weariness
which
is
natural
to
all

when

hope
that

be
able

This

the

The

to

plot
was

Tyckelaer

But

was
not

All

was
the

This

as

now

the

Hearing

the

showed
signs

retired
into

The

bowed

,
without

followed

At

he
observed
the

clenched

glittering

It

the

the

triumph

he
cried

asked
the

The

looked
first
at

then
at

,
with
a
glance
full
of
the
most
tender
gratitude
.
``
I
have
foreseen
his

just
now
whilst
he
was
talking
from

I
took

<UNK>
by

,
they
descended
a
staircase
of
about
a

;
traversed
a
small
courtyard
,
which
was
surrounded
by
<UNK>
walls
;
and
,
the

having
been
opened
for

by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
emerged
into
a
lonely
street
where
their

was
ready

receive
them
.
Yet
,
after
having
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
get
into
the

first
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
round
towards
the

,
to
whom
he
said
,
-
``

Go

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
iron

leading

the

in
which
a

waiting
for

<UNK>
as
the

was
,
and
although
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
do
him
justice

stoutly
enough
refused

open
it

yet
evidently
it
could
not
resist
much
longer
,
and
the
jailer
,
growing
very
pale
,
put
to
himself
the
question
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
open
the

than

felt

gently
pulling
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
his

,
and
the
trap-door
closed
over
his

,
just
as
the

gave
admittance
to

Death

Do

Look

the

called
out

the

the

At

the

felt
his

run
cold

as
somehow

he
was
convinced

the

was
lost

All
at

he

the

The

stopped

looking

being

quite

``

the

<PROPER_NOUN>

putting

risking

``

These

meant
mischief

not

The

carried
in

the

who
,
trying

It
rose
above

like

Behind
him
appeared
the

almost
as
pale
as

``

``
Indeed

The

-
a

would

been

impossible

grew
even
paler
than
before
,
and
his

were
for

veiled
behind
the

``
These

``
Oh

<PROPER_NOUN>

trying

blinded
him

what

The

then
turned
his

round
,

,
taking

by

barrel
with
both

struck

down

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

We
can
not
take
upon
ourselves
to
say
whether

through

almost

chink

the

witnessed

at

he
passed
through

the

the

inform

at

that
these

were
only

for

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
hero
of

,
as
his
landed

yielded
him
an
income
of
about
<NUMBER>

a

Having

died

to

who
cared
very

for

Consequently
,
and
to
indulge
his

idea

<PROPER_NOUN>
began

collected

at

being
at

what

with
his

and
especially
with
his

,
which
went
on
<UNK>
at
a
most

he
took
it
into

select

from
all
the

country
and
of

age

<NUMBER>

the

-

became

His

indeed

were
crowned
with
a

result
:
he
produced
<NUMBER>

which

after

the

have
escaped
us
,
but
the
fanciers
will
be
sure
to
find
them
in
the

of
the
times
.
It
is
true
,
they
did
not
particularly
like
his
somewhat
austere
<UNK>
,
but
they
were
proud
of
his
<UNK>
;
and
when
he
made
his
entrance
into
their
town
,
the
cup
of
honour
was
offered
to
him
,
readily
enough
,
in
the
name
of
the
city
.
And
yet
it
must
be
said
,
to
the
disgrace
of
mankind
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
being
aware
of

had
a

more
ferocious

fierce

by

by

in

death
made
sure
the
existence

affection
beyond
the

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
the
<UNK>
of
his
frames
to
the
twentieth
part
of
a
degree
.
Several
fanciers
had
come
to
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
tulips
.
He
raised
a
certain
building
in
his
court-yard
by
a
story
,
which
shutting
out
the
sun
,
took
half
a
degree
of
warmth
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
garden
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
added
half
a
degree
of
cold
in
winter
;
not
to
mention
that
it
cut
the
wind
,
and
disturbed
all
the
<UNK>
calculations
and
arrangements
of
his
neighbour
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
painter
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
tulip-grower
;
he
wanted
somewhat
more
sun
for
his
paintings
,
and
he
took
half
a
degree
from
his
neighbour
's
tulips
.
<UNK>
this
was
not
quite
in
accordance
with
the
true
state
of
things
in
general
,
and
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
feelings
in
particular
.
There
were
bundles
of
<UNK>
,
cupboards
,
and
drawers
with
compartments
,
and
wire
guards
for
the
cupboards
,
to
allow
free
access
to
the
air
whilst
keeping
out
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
dormice
,
and
rats
,
all
of
them
very
curious
fanciers
of
tulips
at
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
a
bulb
.
Was
it
not
possible
,
that
,
having
to
paint
the
interior
of
a
tulip-grower
's
,
he
had
collected
in
his
new
<UNK>
all
the
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
?
There
could
not
be
a
doubt
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
become
a
tulip-grower
.
And
thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
have
the
most
admirably
fitted
aspect
,
and
,
besides
,
a
large
,
<UNK>
,
and
well
<UNK>
chamber
where
to
preserve
his
bulbs
and
seedlings
;
while
he
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
for
this
purpose
his
bedroom
,
and
,
lest
his
sleeping
in
the
same
apartment
might
injure
his
bulbs
and
seedlings
,
had
taken
up
his
abode
in
a
miserable
garret
.
It
was
indeed
enough
to
choke
<NUMBER>
with
rage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
all
his
thoughts
ran
only
upon
the
injury
which
his
neighbour
would
cause
him
,
and
thus
his
favourite
occupation
was
changed
into
a
constant
source
of
misery
to
him
.
From
that
<UNK>
the
school
of
<UNK>
,
the
most
<UNK>
of
all
<UNK>
,
worked
out
the
following
<UNK>
in
the
same
year
:
-
``
To
despise
flowers
is
to
offend
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
By
reasoning
of
this
kind
,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
tulip-growers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
leaving
out
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
might
,
if
so
disposed
,
put
the
whole
world
under
the
<UNK>
,
and
condemn
as
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
and
deserving
of
death
the
several
<NUMBER>
millions
of
mankind
whose
hopes
of
salvation
were
not
centred
upon
the
tulip
.
He
went
on
in
his
career
,
and
consequently
in
his
<UNK>
;
and
in
the
course
of
<NUMBER>
years
he
covered
his
borders
with
such
marvellous
productions
as
no
mortal

following

except
perhaps
<PROPER_NOUN>
and

,
have

Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
soon
was
no
longer
content
with

And
then
,
after
the
first
blush
of
the
admiration
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
,
he
began
to
be
tortured
by
the
pangs
of
envy
,
by
that
slow
fever
which
<UNK>
over
the
heart
and
changes
it
into
a
nest
of
<UNK>
,
each
devouring
the
other
and
ever
born
anew
.
But
,
remembering
that
he
would
be
sure
to
be
found
out
,
and
that
he
would
not
only
be
punished
by
law
,
but
also
<UNK>
for
ever
in
the
face
of
all
the
tulip-growers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
recourse
to
stratagem
,
and
,
to
gratify
his
hatred
,
tried
to
devise
a
plan
by
means
of
which
he
might
gain
his
ends
without
being
compromised
himself
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
hidden
behind
his
sycamore
,
could
not
see
anything
,
as
it
was
<UNK>
;
but
the
piercing
cries
of
the
cats
told
the
whole
tale
,
and
his
heart
overflowing
with
gall
now
throbbed
with
triumphant
joy
.
At
the
earliest
dawn
the
door
of
the
white
house
opened
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
his
appearance
,
approaching
the
flower-beds
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
has
passed
the
night
comfortably
in
his
bed
,
and
has
had
happy
dreams
.
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
tulips
,
torn
and
crushed
,
were
lying
about
,
some
of
them
bent
,
others
completely
broken
and
already
withering
,
the
sap
<UNK>
from
their
bleeding
bulbs
:
how
gladly
would
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
have
<UNK>
that
precious
sap
with
his
own
blood
!
They
raised
proudly
their
noble
heads
above
the
corpses
of
their
slain
companions
.
He
besides
found
traces
of
the
cats
,
their
<UNK>
and
hairs
left
behind
on
the
battle-field
;
to
guard
,
therefore
,
in
future
against
a
similar
<UNK>
,
he
gave
orders
that
henceforth
<NUMBER>
of
the
under
gardeners
should
sleep
in
the
garden
in
a
sentry-box
near
the
flower-beds
.
The
tulip-growing
world
,
however
,
was
thrown
by
it
into
a
state
of
most
active
commotion
.
By
the
next
year
he
had
obtained
flowers
of
a
perfect
<UNK>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
them
in
the
border
,
whereas
he
had
himself
as
yet
only
succeeded
in
producing
the
light
brown
.
The
house
of
his
rival
was
quite
open
to
view
;
a
garden
exposed
to
the
sun
;
<UNK>
with
glass
walls
,
shelves
,
cupboards
,
boxes
,
and
ticketed
<UNK>
,
which
could
easily
be
surveyed
by
the
telescope
.
It
might
be
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
up
to
his
laboratory
,
into
the
glazed
cabinet
whither
<PROPER_NOUN>

telescope
had
such
an
easy
access
;
and
here
,
as
soon
as
the
lamp
illuminated
the
walls
and
windows
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
inventive
genius
of
his
rival
at
work
.
For
,
strange
to
say
,
the
love
and
interest
of
horticulture
had
not
deadened
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
his
fierce
envy
and
thirst
of
revenge
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
although
being
very
little
of
a
horticulturist
or
of
an
artist
,
went
over
the
whole
mansion
,
from
the
<UNK>
to
the
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
everything
,
from
the
pictures
down
to
the
tulips
.
This
telescope
had
not
been
of
great
service
to
him
since
the
autumn
of
<NUMBER>
.
He
went
only
rarely
to
the
room
where
he
kept
his
bulbs
,
unless
it
were
to
allow
some
<UNK>
rays
of
the
sun
to
enter
,
by
opening
<NUMBER>
of
the
movable
sashes
of
the
glass
front
.
Never
had
any
of
his
servants
been
bold
enough
to
set
his
foot
there
.
The
envious
spy
was
watching
more
intently
than
ever
.
In
this
figure
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
recognised
the
pale
features
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
long
hair
,
parted
in
front
,
fell
over
his
shoulders
.
But
why
should
papers
of
political
import
be
intrusted
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
not
only
was
,
but
also

to

which

being
secreted

got
up
,
pressed
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
seizing

on

which
was
still
crowded
with

who
wished

Little
dreaming

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
proceeded

towards

stopped

<PROPER_NOUN>
raised

his

entered

,
in

<PROPER_NOUN>

another

As
soon

dark
he
got
up

At
midnight
,
with
a
beating
heart
,
trembling

and
a

he
descended

took

leaned

mounted
it

listened

He

nothing

There

not

as
the
sashes

This

would
do
admirably

On

he
stopped

supporting

his

failed
him

his

read
these

It

At

On

he
heard
nothing

the
barking

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
eager
to
know

any

approached
the
window

and
cast

round
the
circular

a

<UNK>
with

out
in

already
illuminated

pale
light
of
early
morning

<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
,
and
in
the
agony
of
his
frantic
terror
knocked
with
his
hands
and
feet
at
the
door
so
violently

<UNK>
,
that

with

``
Eh

And
seeing

was
not

quiet

entirely
prostrate

senseless

he
rushed
from

What
was
this
circumstance
?
He
then
tried
to
support
himself
on
his
arm
,
but
the
bone
gave
way
;
then
only
he
felt
the
pain
,
and
uttered
a
cry
.
At
the
noise
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
fall
,
and
at
the
cry
which
escaped
him
,
a
hasty
step
was
heard
on
the
staircase
,
and
immediately
after
a
lovely
apparition
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
blushed
,
and
said
,
``
I
am
but
doing
my
duty
as
a
Christian
in
helping
my
neighbour

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
cast
his
eyes
on
the
beautiful
girl
,
quite
astonished
to
hear
from
the
mouth
of
<NUMBER>
so
humble
such
a
noble
and
feeling
speech
.
``
His

``
You

``
Do
you
hear

go

fetch
what

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
the
last
touch
,
the
jailer
fainted
a
second
time
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
But
I
am
not
guilty

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But

your

Do

``
But

''
``
You

oh

sir

``
Halloa

``
Hush

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
What

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rising
and
supporting
his
right

with
his

``
On

my

''
That
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
to
express
,
-
``
There
,
you
see

''
He
did
not
deny
it
.
The
honest
doctor
did
not
confine
himself
to
this
avowal
,
but
told
the
whole
truth
with
regard
to
his
own
tastes
,
habits
,
and
daily
life
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
answered
that
it
was
indeed
so
;
that
,
however
,
he
never
put
his
hand
into
the
press
but
to
ascertain
whether
his
bulbs
were
dry
,
and
that
he
never
looked
into
it
but
to
see
if
they
were
beginning
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
that
undoubtedly
his
godfather
could
not
have
thought
that
there
was
any
risk
for
the
safety
of
his
deposit
,
hidden
as
it
was
in
a
press
which
was
looked
upon
as
sacred
as
the
<UNK>
by
the
whole
household
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
that
consequently
he
had
considered
the
certificate
as
useless
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
did
not
much
press
this
point
,
since
,
even
supposing
that
the
paper
should
turn
up
,
it
could
not
have
any
direct
connection
with
the
correspondence
which
constituted
the
crime
.
The
parcel
was
put
into
my
hands
in
the
way
I
have
described
;
I
vow
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
I
was
,
and
am
still
,
ignorant
of
its
contents
,
and
that
it
was
not
until
my
arrest
that
I
learned
that
this
deposit
was
the
correspondence
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
the

de
<PROPER_NOUN>

<NUMBER>
of
them
,
who
bore
the
character
of
a
profound
observer
,
laid
down
as
his
opinion
that
this
young
man
,
so
phlegmatic
in
appearance
,
must
in
reality
be
very
dangerous
,
as
under
this
icy
exterior
he
was
sure
to
conceal
an
ardent
desire
to
avenge
his
friends
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
concerned
in
the
growing
of
tulips
and
in
the
pursuit
of
politics
at
<NUMBER>
and
the
same
time
,
the
prisoner
is
of
<UNK>
character
,
of
an
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
working
with
equal
<UNK>
at
politics
and
at
tulips
,
which
proves
him
to
belong
to
the
class
of
men
most
dangerous
to
public
tranquillity
,
and
shows
a
certain
,
or
rather
a
complete
,
<UNK>
between
his
character
and
that
of
those
master
minds
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
have
been
<UNK>
<UNK>
as
examples

''
As
this
<UNK>
was
a
most
serious
affair
,
it
lasted
a
full
half-hour
,
during
which
the
prisoner
was
<UNK>
to
his
cell

Behind
this

who
introduced
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
fair
Frisian
maid
,
had
slipped
into
the
recess
of
the
door
,
with
a
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
to
stifle
her
sobs
.
``
Only
I
confess
that
,
among
all
the
causes
of
death
against
which
a
cautious
man
may
guard

I

never
have
supposed
this
to

comprised
.
''
A
sob
was
heard
behind
the
door
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
round
to
look
from
whom
it
came
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
foreseen
this

fallen
back

``
Indeed

said
the

bowing
to
the
ground
.
But
the

put
his
heavy
keys
into
the
white
hand
which
was
stretched
out
to
receive
them
,
and
,
descending
some
steps
,
sat
down
on
the
staircase
which
was
thus
guarded
above
by
himself
,
and
below
by
the

she
said
,
but
sobs
choked
her
utterance
.
``
Do
n't
weep
so
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
prisoner
,
``
for
your

go
much
more
to
my

my

you

the

a

is
,
the
more
it
is
his
duty

die
calmly

joyfully

as

dies
a

``
Your

``

The

Then
,
taking
the

with
the

suckers
from
his
breast
,
where
he
had
again
put
it
,
since
he

no

any

he
said
:

<PROPER_NOUN>
took

They

I

quite

``
And

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
wiping
away
a
tear
which
was
glistening
in
his

and
which
was
shed
much
more
for
that
marvellous
black

which
he
was
not

for
the

was
about

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
then
read
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
testament
that
he
had
just
made
.
``
Oh

I
do

she
stammered

I
should
have
thought

``

she
said

without
raising

``
I

in

He
was
followed
by
the
executioner
,
by
the
soldiers
who
were
to
form
the
guard
round
the
scaffold
,
and
by
some
curious
<UNK>
of
the
prison
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whilst
falling
down
senseless
,
still
obeying
her
friend
,
had
pressed
her
hand
on
her
velvet
bodice
and
,
forgetting
everything
in
the
world
besides
,
instinctively
grasped
the
precious
deposit
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
intrusted
to
her
care
.
The
dog
perhaps
knew
the
condemned
prisoners
,
and
only
bit
those
who
left
as
free
men
.
The
scaffold
indeed
looked
like
an
islet
at
the
<UNK>
of
several
rivers
.
He
thought
of
the
beautiful
tulips
which
he
would
see
from
heaven
above
,
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
or
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
or
elsewhere
,
when
he
would
be
able
to
look
with
pity
on
this
earth
,
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
murdered
for
having
thought
too
much
of
politics
,
and
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
be
murdered
for
having
thought
too
much
of
tulips
.
He
knelt
down
,
said
his
prayers
,
and
observed
,
not
without
a
feeling
of
sincere
joy
,
that
,
laying
his
head
on
the
block
,
and
keeping
his
eyes
open
,
he
would
be
able
to
his
last
moment
to
see
the
grated
window
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
bade
farewell
to
the
great
black
tulip
,
certain
of
awaking
in
another
world
full
of
light
and
glorious
<UNK>
.
Then
suddenly
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
gentle
hands
raising
him
,
and
soon
stood
on
his
feet
again
,
although
trembling
a
little
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
be
sensible
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
mistaken
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
this
clause
,
but
,
the
first
feeling
of
vexation
and
disappointment
over
,
he
said
to
himself
,
-
``
Never
mind
,
all
this
is
not
lost
yet

there
is
some
good

this

will
be
there
,
and
also
my
<NUMBER>
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
are
there
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
sufficiently
versed
in
the
history
of
his
country
to
know
that
the
celebrated
<UNK>
was
confined
in
that
castle
after
the
death
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
in
their
generosity
to
the
illustrious
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
historian
,
poet
,
and
divine
,
had
granted
to
him
for
his
daily
<UNK>
the
sum
of
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
.
``
Ah
!
''
This
vehicle
was
for
the
prisoner
.
But
the
coach
was
drawn
by
good
horses
,
who
soon
carried
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
away
from
among
the
shouts
which
the
rabble
roared
in
honour
of
the
most
<UNK>
Stadtholder
,
<UNK>
with
it
a
<UNK>
of
abuse
against
the
brothers
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
godson
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
just
now
been
saved
from
death
.
The
most
furious
had
come
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
daybreak
,
to
secure
a
better
place
;
but
he
,
<UNK>
even
them
,
had
passed
the
night
at
the
threshold
of
the
prison
,
from
whence
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
he
had
advanced
to
the
very
foremost
rank
,
<UNK>
et
<UNK>
,
-
that
is
to
say
,
<UNK>
some
,
and
<UNK>
the
others
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
at
first
tried
to
gain
over
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
his
interest
,
but
the
jailer
had
not
only
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
but
likewise
the
fidelity
,
of
a
dog
.
He
came
back
to
the
charge
,
but
this
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
in
bed
,
feverish
,
and
with
a
broken
arm
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
no
more
time
to
<UNK>
any
<NUMBER>
.
But
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
calculations
of
the
envious
neighbour
would
have
been
correct
.
But
what
was
the
sum
of
a
<NUMBER>
guilders
to
a
man
who
was
all
but
sure
to
buy
with
it
the
prize
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
The
thing
was
,
moreover
,
quite
customary
among
the
``
faithful
brethren
,
''
when
<NUMBER>
of
their
masters
died
a
public
death
in
the
yard
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
in
advance
,
and
waited
.
and
would
he
not
,
in
falling
,
crush
those
<UNK>
bulbs
?
But
when
he
saw
the
Recorder
take
the
hand
of
the
condemned
,
and
raise
him
,
whilst
drawing
forth
the
parchment
from
his
pocket
,
-
when
he
heard
the
pardon
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
publicly
read
out
,
-
then
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
no
more
like
a
human
being
;
the
rage
and
malice
of
the
tiger
,
of
the
<UNK>
,
and
of
the
serpent
glistened
in
his
eyes
,
and
vented
itself
in
his
<UNK>
and
his
movements
.
They
,
mistaking
the
frantic
cries
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
demonstrations
of
joy
,
began
to
<UNK>
him
with
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
,
such
as
could
not
have
been
administered
in
better
style
by
any
<UNK>
on
the
other
side
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<NUMBER>
would
think
that
this
was
enough
for
<NUMBER>
day
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
seem
to
think
so
,
as
,
in
addition
to
having
his
clothes
torn
,
his
back
bruised
,
and
his
hands
scratched
,
he
inflicted
upon
himself
the
further
punishment
of
tearing
out
his

by

,
as

offering
to

goddess
of

who

as
<UNK>
<UNK>
us

The

had
a

bad
character
at

castle
since
the
time
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
by
means
of
the
device
of
his

made

famous
<UNK>
which
the
jailers
forgot
to
examine
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
himself
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
the
place
where
he
had
to
lead
an
existence
which
was
little
more
than
vegetation
.
In
his
prison
cell
the
most
adventurous
life
which
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
any
tulip-fancier
was
reserved
for
him
.
Then
,
after
a
few
moments
'
consideration
,
he
exclaimed
,
-
``
I
will
do
it
.
''
She
returned
in
the
evening
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
addressed
it
to
his
nurse
,
the
old
Frisian
woman
;
and
implored
any
charitable
soul
who
might
find
it
to
convey
it
to
her
as
safely
and
as
speedily
as
possible
.
The
servant
,
having
been
left
without
wages
,
first
lived
on
his
little
savings
,
and
then
on
his
master
's
pigeons
.
This
being
just
double
their
value
,
the
man
was
very
glad
to
close
the
bargain
,
and
the
nurse
found
herself
in
<UNK>
possession
of
the
pigeons
of
her
master
's
envious
neighbour
.
The
note
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
nurse
.
Let
us
confess
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
so
stupefied
with
surprise
,
or
so
beyond
himself
with
joy
,
as
he
would
have
been
but
for
the
pigeon
,
which
,
in
answer
to
his
letter
,
had
brought
back
hope
to
him
under
her
empty
wing
;
and
,
knowing
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
expected
,
if
the
note
had
ever
reached
her
,
to
hear
of
her
whom
he
loved
,
and
also
of
his
<NUMBER>
darling
bulbs
.
Whilst
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
this
point
within
himself
,
was
building
all
sorts
of
castles
in
the
air
,
and
was
struggling
between
hope
and
fear
,
the
shutter
of
the
grating
in
the
door
opened
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
beaming
with
joy
,
and
beautiful
in
her
pretty
national
costume
-
but
still
more
beautiful
from
the
grief
which
for
the
last
<NUMBER>
months
had
blanched
her
cheeks
-
pressed
her
little
face
against
the
wire
grating
of
the
window
,
saying
to
him
,
-
``
Oh
,
sir
,
sir
!
let
us
speak
low
:
my
father
follows
on
my

said
the
girl
.
``

``
As

<PROPER_NOUN>
tenderly
stretched
out
his

towards
her
,
but
they
were
only
able
to
touch
each

with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
through
the

The
turnkey
took
the
animal
round
the
<UNK>
,
so
that
,
if
needs
be
,
he
might
recognize
the
prisoners
.
Ah
!
The
dog
,
on
his
part
,
went
up
to
the

,
growling

<UNK>
about
his

``

They

spend

And
whilst
the

smiled
ironically
at
the
old
jailer
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
the
outside
,
answered
by
a

smile
,
which
carried
sweet

asked

<PROPER_NOUN>
time
to

and
squeeze
the
hand
of

who
whispered
to

,
-

This

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
this

passed
<NUMBER>
of
the
worst
nights
he
ever
had
in
his
life
.
But
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
her
secluded
chamber
,
could
not
have
known
of
whom
or
of
what
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
dreaming

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a

and
was
wealthy

-
at

he

<PROPER_NOUN>
belonged

But
as

knew
with

looked

at

I

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
aware
of
it

He
,
on
his
part
,
awoke
deeper
in
love
than
ever
.
How
his
heart
beat
when
darkness
closed
in
!
Never
did
the
metal
voice
vibrate
more
forcibly
through
the
heart
of
any
man
than
did
the
last
stroke
,
marking
the
<UNK>
hour
,
through
the
heart
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
evening
none
of
those
little
noises
broke
the
silence
of
the
lobby
,
the
clock
struck
<NUMBER>
,
and
a
quarter
;
the
half-hour
,
then
a
quarter
to
<NUMBER>
,
and
at
last
its
deep
tone
announced
,
not
only
to
the
inmates
of
the
fortress
,
but
also
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
Loewestein
,
that
it
was
<NUMBER>
.
``
Alas
!
''
It
was
a
long
and
sad
night
for
him
,
and
the
day
brought
no
hope
to
the
prisoner
.
He
even
very
nearly
made
this
inquiry
,
strange
as
it
would
needs
have
appeared
to
her
father
.
Yet
his
sudden
<UNK>
,
his
listening
at
the
door
,
his
rapid
glances
at
every
little
noise
towards
the
grated
window
,
showed
clearly
that
the
prisoner
entertained
some
<UNK>
hope
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
,
somehow
or
other
,
break
her
rule
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
being
little
used
to
this
sort
of
civility
on
the
part
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
began
to
suspect
that
his
prisoner
was
about
to
try
and
<UNK>
him
.
On
the
following
day
Gryphus
appeared
to
him
even
more
hideous
,
brutal
,
and
hateful
than
usual
;
in
his
mind
,
or
rather
in
his
heart
,
there
had
been
some
hope
that
it
was
the
old
man
who
prevented
his
daughter
from
coming
.
He
had
said
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
``
I
shall
tell
you
the
day
when
you
are
to
put
the
bulb
in
the
ground
.
''
These
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
combined
might
well
make
him
leave
off
eating
and
drinking
.
In
the
evening
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
away
the
breakfast
and
dinner
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
scarcely
touched
them
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
startled
.
``
He
does
n't
drink
,
he
does
n't
eat
,
he
does
n't
leave
his
bed
.
she
said
to
herself
,
``
he
is
uneasy
about
his
tulip
.
''
Although
these
few
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
somewhat
soothed
the
grief
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
yet
he
felt
not
the
less
the
irony
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
them
.
He
guessed
that
she
expected
an
answer
,
but
that
she
would
not
come
before
the
evening
to
fetch
it
.
Now
to-morrow
was
the
eighth
day
.
Seeing
him
so
sad
and
pale
,
she
was
startled
,
and
said
,
-
``
You
are
ill
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
``
And
I
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
have
answered
.
Not
only
do
you
read
very
<UNK>
,
but
also
you
have
made
marvellous
progress

writing
.
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
have
you
any
good
news
to
communicate
to
me
?
''
He
did
not
suspect
what
lay
hidden
under
this
appearance
of
indifference
with
which
the
poor
girl
affected
to
speak
of
her
rival
,
the
black
tulip
.
Have
I
not
told
you
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
I
thought
but
of
you
?
she
said
,
``
your
tulip
has
been
in
such
danger
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
him
with
gentle
compassion
;
she
felt
that
what
she
wished
was
beyond
the
power
of
this
man
,
and
that
he
must
be
taken
as
he
was
,
with
his
little
<UNK>
.
``
He
came
for
the
sake
of
the
tulip
.
''
``
Oh
,
pardon
me
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
On
the
day
,
therefore
,
after
that
on
which
I
saw
you
last
,
and
on
which
you
said

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
interrupted
her
.
I
have
asked
your
pardon
for
that
unfortunate
speech
before
.
``
I
do
hate
him

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
as
he
is
the
cause
of
all
the
unhappiness
I
have
suffered
these
<NUMBER>
days
.
''
``
And
then
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
,
remembering
all
the
details
of
the
advice
which
he
had
given
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
There
you
see
,
there
you
see

''
``
He
waited
for
a
moment
,
very
likely
to
make
sure
of
my
not
coming
back
,
after
which
he
<UNK>
forth
from
his
hiding-place
,
and
approached
the
border
by
a

<UNK>
;
at
last
,
having
reached
his
goal
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
spot
where
the
ground
was
newly
turned
,
he
stopped
with
a
careless
air
,
looking
about
in
all
directions

and
scanning
every
corner
of
the
garden

every
window

houses

the

after

,
thinking
himself
quite
alone

quite
isolated
,
and
out
of
everybody

sight
,
he
pounced
upon
the
border
,
plunged
both
his
hands
into
the
soft
soil
,
took
a
handful
of
the
mould
,
which
he
gently
<UNK>
between
his
fingers
to
see
whether
the
bulb
was
in
it
,
and
repeated
the
same
thing
twice
or
<NUMBER>
times
,
until
at
last
he
perceived
that
he
was
<UNK>

``
Oh

The

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
what

?
``
Oh

in

``
It

through

Here
the

paused

anxiously
taking

``

What

Then
,
suddenly
checking
himself
,
he
said
,
with
a
faltering
voice
,
-

``
Yes

Every

he
fancied
he
heard
the
gentle
voice

calling
him
.
What
would
the

say

The

can
not
but
have
recognized
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
our
old
friend

or
rather
enemy
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
has
guessed

no

that
this
worthy
had
followed
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
object

and
the
object

his
hatred
,
-
the
black
tulip
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
first
he
had
also
made
some
way
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
not
,
indeed
,
in
her
affections
,
but
inasmuch
as
,
by
talking
to
her
of
marriage
and
of
love
,
he
had
<UNK>
all
the
suspicions
which
he
might
otherwise
have
excited
.
From
that
moment
he
began
to
<UNK>
the
steps
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
not
only
following
her
to
the
garden
,
but
also
to
the
<UNK>
.
He
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
conveying
a
large
flower-pot
of
white
earthenware
from
her
father
's
kitchen
to
her
bedroom
.
From
morning
to
sunset
the
flower-pot
was
in
the
window
,
and
,
like
those
charming
female
figures
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
at
that
window
as
in
a
frame
,
formed
by
the
first
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
the
wild
<UNK>
and
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
her
window
.
Well
,
it
was
then
quite
evident
she
was
following
the
instructions
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
afraid
of
the
bulb
being
killed
by
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
possessed
<NUMBER>
bulbs
,
and
the
second
was
intrusted
to
the
love
and
care
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
watched
over
her
tulip
as
a
mother
over
her
child
,
or
a
dove
over
her
eggs
.
Would
the
coolness
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
last
for
ever
?
The
point
was
to
steal
the
tulip
.
The
lock
was
a
double
<NUMBER>
and
in
good
order
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
always
took
the
key
with
her

<NUMBER>
of
the
keys
entered
the
lock
,
and
<NUMBER>
of
them
turned
round
once
,
but
not
the
second
time
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
door
thus
opened
without
noise
and
without
difficulty
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
himself
in
her
room
alone
with
the
tulip
.
A
common
thief
would
have
taken
the
pot
under
his
arm
,
and
carried
it
off
.
Should
any
<NUMBER>
then
reclaim
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
in
his
turn
charge
him
or
her
with
theft
.
Seeing
<PROPER_NOUN>
enter
her
room
<NUMBER>
minutes
after
she
had
left
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
guessed
that
the
tulip
had
opened
,
or
was
about
to
open
.
At
eleven
o'clock
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
dead
drunk
.
Would
she
set
out
that
instant
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
it

He
followed
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
his
<UNK>
feet
,
walking
on
tiptoe
.
He
heard
the
plan
concerted

<PROPER_NOUN>

send

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
saw
all
this
whilst
hiding

on

descended
step

from

descended

so
that

touched

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
touched
with

the

He
was
quite

<UNK>

started
before

<PROPER_NOUN>

in

made

He
proceeded
but
slowly
,
as
the
black
tulip
could
not
bear
travelling
<UNK>
.
After
which
he
wrote
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
a
letter

announced

took
up

On

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

now
crushed

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
up
a
little
parcel
of
things
indispensable
for
a
journey
;
took
her
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
guilders
,
-
that
is

all
her

fetched
the
third

from
among
her
lace

where
she
had
laid
it
up

and
carefully
hid
it
in

after

she
locked

twice
to
disguise
her
flight
as

as
possible

and
,
leaving
the
prison
by
the

door
which
an
hour
before
had
let
out
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
went
to
a

to
hire

And
in
fact
she
had
not
proceeded
more
than
a
league
before
she
saw
him
hastening
along
<NUMBER>
of
the
side
paths
of
a

pretty
road
by

river

The
boatman
placed

weeping
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
making

He
first
went
to
her
room

but
,
loud
as

knocked

<PROPER_NOUN>
answered
not

The

may
imagine
the
anger

the
jailer
when

after
having
made
inquiries

he
heard
that
his

and
,
like

set
out

without

The

had
started

still
standing
at

leaning

looking
through

All
her
attention

may
be
easily
imagined
,
was
fixed
on
that
important
person
who
was
called
<PROPER_NOUN>

so
that

a
moment
;
then
with
a
tone
which
came
from
the
depth
of
her
heart
,
she
said
,
-
``

The
tone
of
his
voice
startled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
sure
she
had
heard
it
before
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
trembled
as
he
heard
such
a
confession
made
in
the
presence
of
such
a
witness
.
``
Alas

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

by
means
of

offered
,
in

his
thanks
to
the
new
member

the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

``
<UNK>
what

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
this
moment
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
,
and
announced
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
the
person
whom
he
had
been
to

following
on
his

with

now
heard
the
voice

``

cried

,
``

more
than

At

the

as

<PROPER_NOUN>
hesitated

the

lying

a

flashed

a

paleness
spread
over

down

from

<PROPER_NOUN>
said
,
with
a
faltering
voice
,
and
evidently
alarmed
at
the
attention
with
which
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
examined
the
bulb
;
and
even
more
at
the
movements
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
reading
some
lines
written
on
the
paper
which
remained
in
her
hands

It
was
that
fly-leaf
,
taken
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
sent

you
will
have
saved

de

This
slip
of
paper
offered
the
proofs
both
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
innocence
and
of
his
claim
to
the
property
of
the
tulip
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
wiped
the
cold
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
and
slowly
folded
up
the
paper
,
whilst
his
thoughts
were
wandering
in
that
labyrinth
without
a
goal
and
without
a
guide
,
which
is
called
remorse
and
shame
for
the
past
.
All
bowed
,
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
,
among
the
deafening
cheers
of
the
crowd
outside
.
Whilst
the
events
we
have
described
in
our
last
chapter
were
taking
place
,
the
unfortunate
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
forgotten
in
his
cell
in
the
fortress
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
suffered
at
the
hands
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
all
that
a
prisoner
can
suffer
when
his
jailer
has
formed
the
determination
of
playing
the
part
of
hangman
.
The
pigeons
were
still
there
,
but
hope
was
not
there
;
there
was
no
future
to
look
forward
to
.
and
if
so
,
could
she
convey
her
letters
to
him
?
Did
this
brutal
,
<UNK>
,
drunken
bully
take
revenge
on
his
daughter
,
like
the
<UNK>
fathers
of
the
Greek
drama
?
He
asked
himself
whether
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
just
in
<UNK>
so
much
<UNK>
on
<NUMBER>
innocent
creatures
.
He
also
would
have
wished
to
write
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
be
beforehand
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
would
by
<UNK>
him
do
his
best
to
bring
new
storms
on
his

.
He
had
thought
of
an
attempt
to
escape
,
a
thing
which
never
entered
his
head
whilst
he
could
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
every
day
;
but
the
more
he
thought
of
it
,
the
more
clearly
he
saw
the
<UNK>
of
such
an
attempt
.
Are
not
the
windows
barred
?
But
suppose
I
should
waste
<NUMBER>
years
of
my
life
in
making
a

to

off

cords

myself
down
from

window
,
or
in

wings
on

fly

like
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
Some
fine
day
<PROPER_NOUN>
will
commit
some

get
at

strangle
him

Whatever
may
be
her
affection
for
me
,
she
will
never
approve
of
my
having
strangled
her
father
,
brutal
and
malicious
as
he
has
been
.
But
,
then
,
what
is
to
become
of
me
,
and
how
shall
I
find
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
him
enter
,
and
guessed
that
it
was
he
,
but
did
not
turn
round
,
as
he
knew
well
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
coming
after
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
humming
between
his
teeth
the
``
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
-
a
sad
but
very
charming
song
,
-
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
round
,
merely
saying
,
``

then
began
his
song
again

up

said

flourished
his

above

moved
not

standing

was
taken
down
by

to
his

groaning
and
covered
with

He
had
found
his

thrown

at

its

this

was
such

that

a

could

were

for

construction

that

for

carried

as
innocent

held

This

there
was
no

neither

In

this
pacific

was
seen

were
decorated

the
procession
halted

amidst

their

<UNK>
as
had
been
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
glance
,
it
had
served
to
give
him
an
idea
of
the
man
he
was
about
to
interrogate
.
An

after
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered

demanded
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
over
a
pile
of
papers
,
containing
information
relative

the
prisoner
,
that
a
police
agent
had
given
to
him
on
his
entry
,
and
that
,
already
,
in
an

,
had
swelled
to
<UNK>
proportions
,
thanks
to
the
corrupt

always
made
the

``

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>

said
the

,
shuddering
in
spite
of
himself
.
When
this
speech
was
arranged
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Tell
me
on

you

he
,
with

If
I
obtain
the

I
shall
owe
it

With
the
deputy
's
knowledge
of
crime
and
criminals
,
every
word
the
young
man
uttered
convinced
him
more
and
more
of
his
innocence

I
hope
I
shall
gain

easily

A

passed
over
his

said

asked

proudly

<PROPER_NOUN>
fell
back
on
his

passed
his

over
his
brow
,
moist
with
perspiration
,
and
,
for
the
third

read
the

Oh

suddenly

``
Oh

It
was

who
seemed
to
entreat

the

who
reassured
him

``
It

A
police
agent
entered
.
Hardly
had
the
door
closed
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
threw
himself
half-fainting
into
a
chair
.
Suddenly
a
light
passed
over
his
face
,
a
smile
played
round
his
set
mouth
,
and
his
haggard
eyes
were
fixed
in
thought
.
The
commissary
of
police
,
as
he
traversed
the
ante-chamber
,
made
a
sign
to
<NUMBER>
gendarmes
,
who
placed
themselves
<NUMBER>
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
right
and
the
other
on
his
left
.
The
commissary
took
up
an
iron
<UNK>
and
knocked
thrice
,
every
blow
seeming
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
if
struck
on
his
heart
.
It
was
<NUMBER>
o'clock
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
placed
in
this
chamber

By
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
glittering
<UNK>
and
carbines
of
<NUMBER>
gendarmes

``
Yes
,
''
replied
a
gendarme
.
A
carriage
waited
at
the
door
,
the
coachman
was
on
the
box
,
and
a
police
officer
sat
beside
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
speak
;
but
feeling
himself
urged
forward
,
and
having
neither
the
power
nor
the
intention
to
resist
,
he
mounted
the
steps
,
and
was
in
an
instant
seated
inside
between
<NUMBER>
gendarmes
;
the
<NUMBER>
others
took
their
places
opposite
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
heavily
over
the
stones
.
The
carriage
stopped
,
the
officer
descended
,
approached
the
guardhouse
,
a
dozen
soldiers
came
out
and
formed
themselves
in
order
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
reflection
of
their
muskets
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
on
the
quay
.
The
<NUMBER>
gendarmes
who
were
opposite
to
him
descended
first
,
then
he
was
ordered
to
alight
and
the
gendarmes
on
each
side
of
him
followed
his
example
.
At
a
shout
from
the
boat
,
the
chain
that
closes
the
mouth
of
the
port
was
lowered
and
in
a
second
they
were
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
,
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
outside
the
inner
harbor
.
They
had
passed
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
were
now
off
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
about
to
double
the
battery
.
``
You
will
soon
know

''
The
boat
they
were
in
could
not
make
a
long
voyage
;
there
was
no
vessel
at
anchor
outside
the
harbor
;
he
thought
,
perhaps
,
they
were
going
to
leave
him
on
some
distant
point
.
He
waited
silently
,
striving
to
pierce
through
the
darkness
.
<NUMBER>
light
alone
was
visible
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
that
it
came
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
chamber
.
What
would
his
guards
think
if
they
heard
him
shout
like
a
madman
?
While
he
had
been
absorbed
in
thought
,
they
had
<UNK>
their
oars
and
hoisted
sail
;
the
boat
was
now
moving
with
the
wind
.
``
On
my
honor
,
I
have
no
idea

''
``
I
swear
to
you
it
is
true

You
see
I
can
not
escape
,
even
if
I
intended

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
and
looked
forward
,
when
he
saw
rise
within
a
<NUMBER>
yards
of
him
the
black
and
frowning
rock
on
which
stands
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
gendarme
smiled
.
``
There
are
only

said
the
gendarme
,
``
a
governor

a
garrison

turnkeys

``
It
is
probable

there

no

``
I
do
not

the

``

He
fell
back
cursing
with
rage
.
And
he
levelled
his
carbine
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
felt
the
muzzle
against
his
temple
.
At
this
moment
the
boat
came
to
a
landing
with
a
violent
shock
.
He
did
not
even
see
the
ocean
,
that
terrible
barrier
against
freedom
,
which
the
prisoners
look
upon
with
utter
despair
.
Certain
Dantes
could
not
escape
,
the
gendarmes
released
him
.
said
a
voice
.
said
the
gendarmes
,
thrusting
<PROPER_NOUN>
forward
.
To-morrow
,
perhaps
,
he
may
change
you
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
alone
in
darkness
and
in
silence
-
cold
as
the
shadows
that
he
felt
breathe
on
his
burning
forehead
.
The
jailer
advanced
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
not
to
perceive
him
.
said
the
jailer
.
continued
he
.
The
jailer
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
left
the
chamber
.
<NUMBER>
thought
in
particular
tormented
him
:
namely
,
that
during
his
journey
hither
he
had
sat
so
still
,
whereas
he
might
,
a
dozen
times
,
have
plunged
into
the
sea
,
and
,
thanks
to
his
powers
of
swimming
,
for
which
he
was
famous
,
have
gained
the
shore
,
concealed
himself
until
the
arrival
of
a
Genoese

vessel
,
escaped
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his
father
could
have
joined
him
.
The
next
morning
at
the
same
hour
,
the
jailer
came
again
.
``
I
wish
to
see
the
governor
.
''
``
What
is
allowed
,
then
?
''
``
Well

then

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

I

``

``

dropping
the

and
sitting
on

as

were

mad

``

unable

unexpected
announcement

The
keeper
would
leave

in
the
background

and
take
all
the
glory
to
himself
.
``

As
<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
near

she
advanced
and
stood
before
him

I
can
do
nothing

And
desirous
of
putting
an
end
to
the
interview
,
he
pushed
by
her
,
and
closed
the
door
,
as
if
to
exclude
the
pain
he
felt
.
Then
he
had
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
If
at
this
moment
the
sweet
voice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
sounded
in
his
ears
<UNK>
for
mercy
,
or
the
fair
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
entered
and
said
,
``
In

his
cold
and
trembling
hands
would
have
signed
his
release
;
but
no
voice
broke
the
stillness
of
the
chamber
,
and
the
door
was
opened
only
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
valet
,
who
came
to
tell
him
that
the
travelling
carriage
was
in
readiness
.
He
started
when
he
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
he
fancied
she
was
again
about
to
plead
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

Meanwhile
what
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
The
lamp
went
out
for
want
of
oil
,
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
darkness
,
and
dawn
came
,
but
she
knew
not
that
it
was
day

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
readily
given
up
the
fight

With
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
sat
between
the
<NUMBER>
empty
bottles
,
while
spectres
danced
in
the
light
of
the
<UNK>
candle
-
spectres
such
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
over
his
<UNK>
pages
,
like
black

fantastic
dust
.
The
life
of
a

was
to
him
of
far
less
value
than
a

especially
when
,
by
taking

away

he
could
increase
the

But
we
know
very

what
had
become
of

interrogate

A
glance
at
the
king
after
this
discreet

subtle
exordium
,
assured
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
the
<UNK>
of
his
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
he
went
on
:
-
``

such

every

up
in

in

an

a

which
menaces
no

than
your

``

the

much

Yes

If

the

the

At
this

the
minister

appeared
at

pale
,
trembling
,
and
as

ready
to
faint

<PROPER_NOUN>
moved
suddenly
towards
the
baron
,
but
the
fright
of
the
courtier
pleaded
for
the
forbearance
of
the
statesman
;
and
besides
,
as
matters
were
,
it
was
much
more
to
his
advantage
that
the
prefect
of
police
should
triumph
over
him
than
that
he
should
humiliate
the
prefect
.
The
minister
of

,
giving
way
to
an
impulse
of
despair
,
was
about
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of

<PROPER_NOUN>

retreated
a

frowned

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
gesture

indescribable
anger

alarm

and
then
drew
himself
up
as

this

struck
him
at
the

in

Who

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
then
suddenly
checking
himself

he
was
silent

then
he
continued
,
``

he
said

bowing

``

he
added
,
with
a
withering

The

bowed
his
head
,
and
while
a
deep
color
overspread
his
cheeks
,
he
stammered
out
,
-
``
By

A
miracle

replaced
me
on

These

were
an

had
uttered
with

confidence
an

replied

said
the

He
remained
in

this

only
increased
the

The

found
the

took

This

had
<UNK>
new

;
he
had
,
till

forgotten
the

now
,
with
a
fragment

plaster
,
he
wrote
the
date

30th
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>

and
made
a
mark
every

,
in
order
not

lose
his

At
the
expiration

the

he

<PROPER_NOUN>
passed

<PROPER_NOUN>
asked

for

however
<UNK>

was
still
a
change
,
and
would
afford

<PROPER_NOUN>
spoke

terrified

exhausted

he

turned
to

Yet
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
a

<NUMBER>

that
made
his
jailer
<UNK>
with
horror

dashed
himself
furiously
against

<UNK>
his
anger
upon
everything

and
chiefly
upon

so
that
the

,
-
a
grain

sand
,
a

or
a
breath

air

annoyed

led
to
<UNK>
of
fury

By
<UNK>

constantly
dwelling

tranquillity
was
death
,
and
if
punishment
were
the
end
in
view
other
tortures
than
death
must
be
invented
,
he
began
to
reflect
on
suicide

This
state
of
mental
anguish
is
,
however

less
terrible
than
the
sufferings
that

the

follow

Dantes
<UNK>
his
past
life
with
composure
,
and
,
looking
forward
with
terror
to
his
future
existence
,
chose
that
middle
line
that
seemed
to
afford
him
a
refuge
.
But
I
did
so
because
I
was
happy
,
because
I
had
not
<UNK>
death
,
because
to
be
cast
upon
a
bed
of
rocks
and
<UNK>
seemed
terrible
,
because
I
was
unwilling
that
I
,
a
creature
made
for
the
service
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
should
serve
for
food
to
the
<UNK>

<UNK>
.
He
could
hang
himself
with
his
handkerchief
to
the
window
bars
,
or
refuse
food
and
die
of
starvation
.
Nearly
<NUMBER>
years
had
passed
away
;
at
the
end
of
the
second
he
had
ceased
to
mark
the
lapse
of
time
.
Nothing
but
the
recollection
of
his
oath
gave
him
strength
to
proceed
.
What
<UNK>
events
might
not
open
his
prison
door
,
and
restore
him
to
liberty
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
hoped
he
was
dying
.
Suddenly
,
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
a
hollow
sound
in
the
wall
against
which
he
was
lying
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
heaven
had
at
length
taken
pity
on
him
,
and
had
sent
this
noise
to
warn
him
on
the
very
brink
of
the
abyss
.
It
lasted
nearly
<NUMBER>
hours
;
he
then
heard
a
noise
of
something
falling
,
and
all
was
silent
.
For
a
week
since
he
had
resolved
to
die
,
and
during
the
<NUMBER>
days
that
he
had
been
carrying
out
his
purpose
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
spoken
to
the
attendant
,
had
not
answered
him
when
he
inquired
what
was
the
matter
with
him
,
and
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
when
he
looked
too
curiously
at
him
;
but
now
the
jailer
might
hear
the
noise
and
put
an
end
to
it
,
and
so
destroy
a
ray
of
something
like
hope
that
soothed
his
last
moments
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
,
and
the
sound
became
more
and
more
distinct
.
It
was
easy
to
ascertain
this
;
but
how
could
he
risk
the
question
?
He
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
soup
which
the
jailer
had
brought
,
rose
,
staggered
towards
it
,
raised
the
vessel
to
his
lips
,
and
drank
off
the
contents
with
a
feeling
of
indescribable
pleasure
.
Then
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
must
put
this
to
the
test
,
but
without
compromising
anybody
.
He
struck
thrice
.
The
day
passed
away
in
utter
silence
-
night
came
without
<UNK>
of
the
noise
.
In
the
morning
the
jailer
brought
him
fresh
provisions
-
he
had
already
devoured
those
of
the
previous
day
;
he
ate
these
listening
anxiously
for
the
sound
,
walking
round
and
round
his
cell
,
shaking
the
iron
bars
of
the
loophole
,
restoring
vigor
and
agility
to
his
limbs
by
exercise
,
and
so
preparing
himself
for
his
future
destiny
.
He
moved
away
,
walked
up
and
down
his
cell
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
and
then
went
back
and
listened
.
He
began
by
moving
his
bed
,
and
looked
around
for
anything
with
which
he
could
pierce
the
wall
,
penetrate
the
moist
<UNK>
,
and
displace
a
stone
.
The
table
and
chair
had
nothing
,
the
<UNK>
had
once
possessed
a
handle
,
but
that
had
been
removed
.
The
breaking
of
his
jug
was
too
natural
an
accident
to
excite
suspicion
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
told
him
that
the
jug
had
fallen
from
his
hands
while
he
was
drinking
,
and
the
jailer
went
<UNK>
to
fetch
another
,
without
giving
himself
the
trouble
to
remove
the
fragments
of
the
broken
<NUMBER>
.
The
prisoner
reproached
himself
with
not
having
thus
employed
the
hours
he
had
passed
in
vain
hopes
,
prayer
,
and
<UNK>
.
It
was
<NUMBER>
of
these
he
had
uncovered
,
and
which
he
must
remove
from
its
<UNK>
.
Suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
him
-
he
smiled
,
and
the
perspiration
dried
on
his
forehead
.
Now
when
evening
came
<PROPER_NOUN>
put
his
plate
on
the
ground
near
the
door
;
the
jailer
,
as
he
entered
,
stepped
on
it
and
broke
it
.
Then
he
looked
about
for
something
to
pour
the
soup
into
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
entire
dinner
service
consisted
of
<NUMBER>
plate
-
there
was
no
alternative
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
beside
himself
with
joy
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
carefully
collected
the
plaster
,
carried
it
into
the
corner
of
his
cell
,
and
covered
it
with
earth
.
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
intend
to
bring
me
another
plate
?
''
I
shall
leave
you
the
saucepan
,
and
pour
your
soup
into
that
.
He
had
noticed
,
however
,
that
the
prisoner
on
the
other
side
had
ceased
to
labor
;
no
matter
,
this
was
a
greater
reason
for
proceeding
-
if
his
neighbor
would
not
come
to
him
,
he
would
go
to
his
neighbor
.
This
would
have
been
a
method
of
reckoning
time
,
had
not
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
long
ceased
to
do
so
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
sighed
;
it
was
evident
that
his
neighbor
<UNK>
him
.
The
unhappy
young

had
not
thought
of
this
.
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not

a

said
the

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
shuddered

``

All

do
know
is

``

``

yet

I
only

a

called

He
then
gave
himself
up
to
his
happiness
.
All
day
<PROPER_NOUN>
walked
up
and
down
his
cell
.
He
would
be
condemned
to
die
,
but
he
was
about
to
die
of
grief
and
despair
when
this
miraculous
noise
recalled
him
to
life

Doubtless
there
was
a
strange
expression
in

,
for
the
jailer
said
,
``
Come

are
you
going

''
The

,
however
,
just
as
he
removed

,
he
heard

;

In

that

on

was
resting
his

,
as
he
knelt
with

in

suddenly
gave
way
;
he
drew

while
a

disappeared
in

opened
beneath

He
had

and
a

reaching

He
received

``

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
astonishment

So
saying

he
displayed

``

``
But

I

As
the
stranger
asked
the
question
,
he
dragged
the
table
beneath
the
window
.
An

afterwards
he
hastily
drew
back

saying

The

pondered

resumed

knew

From
this

then

comes
the

seek
first

the

There

the

reached

creaked

The

paused

guessed

this

The

An

whose
waves
<UNK>
and
roared
as
if
before
the
approach
of
a
storm
.
This
was
an
easy
feat
to
him
,
for
he
usually
attracted
a
crowd
of
spectators
in
the
bay
before
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
he
swam
there
,
and
was
<UNK>
declared
to
be
the
best
swimmer
in
the
port
.
The
islands
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
are
a
league
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
d'If
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
nevertheless
,
determined
to
make
for

But
,
as
we
have
said
,
it
was
at
least
a
league
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
this
island
.
Fear
,
that
relentless
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
efforts
.
He
could
not
see
it
,
but
he
felt
its
presence
.
A
shudder
passed
over
him
.
He
fancied
for
a
moment
that
he
had
been
shot
,
and
listened
for
the
report
;
but
he
heard
nothing
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
,
advanced
a
few
steps
,
and
,
with
a
fervent
prayer
of
gratitude
,
stretched
himself
on
the
granite
.
The
tempest
was
let
loose
and
beating
the
atmosphere
with
its
mighty
wings
;
from
time
to
time
a
flash
of
lightning
stretched
across
the
heavens
like
a
fiery
serpent
,
lighting
up
the
clouds
that
rolled
on
in
vast
<UNK>
waves
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
the
trembling
of
the
rock
beneath
which
he
lay
;
the
waves
,
dashing
themselves
against
it
,
<UNK>
him
with
their
<UNK>
.
He
extended
his
hands
,
and
drank
greedily
of
the
<UNK>
that
had
lodged
in
a
hollow
of
the
rock
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
warn
them
of
their
danger
,
but
they
saw
it
themselves
.
At
the
same
moment
a
violent
crash
was
heard
,
and
cries
of
distress
.
By
degrees
the
wind
abated
,
vast
gray
clouds
rolled
towards
the
west
,
and
the
blue
firmament
appeared
studded
with
bright
stars
.
He
turned
towards
the
fortress
,
and
looked
at
both
sea
and
land
.
``
In
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
hours
,
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
the
turnkey
will
enter
my
chamber

find
the
body

it

give

''
What
can
I
do
?
But
I
can
not
-
-
I
am
starving
.
As
he
spoke
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
toward
the
spot
where
the
<UNK>
had
been
<UNK>
,
and
started
.
``
I
am
saved
!
''
For
an
instant
he
feared
lest
,
instead
of
keeping
in
shore
,
she
should
stand
out
to
sea
;
but
he
soon
saw
that
she
would
pass
,
like
most
vessels
bound
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
between
the
islands
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
then
he
rejoiced
at
his
precaution
in
taking
the
timber
,
for
without
it
he
would
have
been
unable
,
perhaps
,
to
reach
the
vessel
-
certainly
to
return
to
shore
,
should
he
be
unsuccessful
in
attracting
attention
.
This
time
he
was
both
seen
and
heard
,
and
the
tartan
instantly
steered
towards
him
.
But
he
had
reckoned
too
much
upon
his
strength
,
and
then
he
realized
how
serviceable
the
timber
had
been
to
him
.
The
word
reached
his
ear
as
a
wave
which
he
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
<UNK>
passed
over
his
head
.
He
felt
himself
seized
by

then
he
saw
and
heard
nothing

They
were
rapidly
leaving

a
<UNK>
full
of
rum
to
his
mouth
;
while
the
third
,
an
old
sailer
,
at

the
pilot

looked
on
with
that
egotistical

for
a

that
they
have
escaped
yesterday
,
and
which
may
overtake
them
to-morrow

``

replied

in

``

``

``
It

a

;
``

it

''
``
Yes

he
,
``

The

obeyed

on

This

was
also

repeated
the
sailors
.
``
Ah

''
said
the
captain
,
``
we
can
agree
very
well
,
if

returned
the

``
No

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

said
the

cried
the

said
the

``

``
At

asked
he

who
sat
down

``
Yes

replied
the

,
``
I
ask

``
The

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
hatred
as
he
thought
of
the
<NUMBER>
men
who
had
caused
him
so
long
and
wretched
a
captivity
.
Without
having
been
in
the
school
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
worthy
master
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
-LRB-
the
name
of
the
Genoese
tartan
-RRB-
knew
a
<UNK>
of
all
the
tongues
spoken
on
the
shores
of
that
large
lake
called
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
the
Arabic
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
this
,
while
it
spared
him
<UNK>
,
persons
always
troublesome
and
frequently
indiscreet
,
gave
him
great
<UNK>
of
communication
,
either
with
the
vessels
he
met
at
sea
,
with
the
small
boats
sailing
along
the
coast
,
or
with
the
people
without
name
,
country
,
or
occupation
,
who
are
always
seen
on
the
quays
of
<UNK>
,
and
who
live
by
hidden
and
mysterious
means
which
we
must
suppose
to
be
a
direct
gift
of
providence
,
as
they
have
no
visible
means
of
support
.
But
the
skilful
manner
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
handled
the
lugger
had
entirely
reassured
him
;
and
then
,
when
he
saw
the
light
plume
of
smoke
floating
above
the
bastion
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
heard
the
distant
report
,
he
was
instantly
struck
with
the
idea
that
he
had
on
board
his
vessel
<NUMBER>
whose
coming
and
going
,
like
that
of
kings
,
was
accompanied
with
salutes
of
artillery
.
Moreover
,
it
is
possible
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
those
shrewd
persons
who
know
nothing
but
what
they
should
know
,
and
believe
nothing
but
what
they
should
believe
.
His
comrades
believed
that
his
vow
was
fulfilled
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
barber
said
nothing
and
went
to
work
.
This
was
now
all
changed
.
Moreover
,
from
being
so
long
in
twilight
or
darkness
,
his
eyes
had
acquired
the
faculty
of
distinguishing
objects
in
the
night
,
common
to
the
<UNK>
and
the
wolf
.
It
was
in
this
costume
,
and
bringing
back
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
shirt
and
trousers
he
had
lent
him
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
reappeared
before
the
captain
of
the
lugger
,
who
had
made
him
tell
his
story
over
and
over
again
before
he
could
believe
him
,
or
recognize
in
the
neat
and
trim
sailor
the
man
with
thick
and
matted
beard
,
hair
<UNK>
with
<UNK>
,
and
body
<UNK>
in
<UNK>
,
whom
he
had
picked
up
naked
and
nearly
drowned
.
The
master
was
to
get
all
this
out
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
free
of
duties
,
and
land
it
on
the
shores
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
certain
speculators
undertook
to
forward
the
cargo
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Besides
,
what
would
the
sailors
say
?
Would
he
not
have
accepted
liberty
without
riches
if
it
had
been
offered
to
him
?
<UNK>
came
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
island
tinged
with
the
shades
of
twilight
,
and
then
disappear
in
the
darkness
from
all
eyes
but
his
own
,
for
he
,
with
vision
accustomed
to
the
gloom
of
a
prison
,
continued
to
behold
it
last
of
all
,
for
he
remained
alone
upon
deck
.
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
came
off
with
very
little
noise
alongside
the
lugger
,
which
,
no
doubt
,
in
<UNK>
of
the
compliment
,
lowered
her
own
<UNK>
into
the
sea
,
and
the
<NUMBER>
boats
worked
so
well
that
by
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
all
the
cargo
was
out
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
on
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
The
second
operation
was
as
successful
as
the
first
,
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
in
luck
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
almost
glad
of
this
<UNK>
,
and
almost
pleased
at
being
wounded
,
for
they
were
rude
lessons
which
taught
him
with
what
eye
he
could
view
danger
,
and
with
what
<UNK>
he
could
bear
suffering
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
him
fall
,
had
believed
him
killed
,
and
rushing
towards
him
raised
him
up
,
and
then
attended
to
him
with
all
the
kindness
of
a
devoted
comrade
.
As
a
result
of
the
sympathetic
devotion
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
from
the
first
bestowed
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
latter
was
moved
to
a
certain
degree
of
affection
.
He
pointed
out
to
him
the
bearings
of
the
coast
,
explained
to
him
the
<UNK>
of
the
compass
,
and
taught
him
to
read
in
that
vast
book
opened
over
our
heads
which
they
call
heaven
,
and
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
writes
in
azure
with
letters
of
diamonds
.
Your
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
became
emperor
.
''
He
then
formed
a
resolution
.
<UNK>
had
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
prudent
,
and
he
was
desirous
of
running
no
risk
whatever
.
This
time
it
was
a
great
matter
that
was
under
discussion
,
connected
with
a
vessel
laden
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
carpets
,
stuffs
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<UNK>
.
At
the
mention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
started
with
joy
;
he
rose
to
conceal
his
emotion
,
and
took
a
turn
around
the
<UNK>
tavern
,
where
all
the
languages
of
the
known
world
were
<UNK>
in
a
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
Thus
,
at
length
,
by
<NUMBER>
of
the
unexpected
strokes
of
fortune
which
sometimes
befall
those
who
have
for
a
long
time
been
the
victims
of
an
evil
destiny
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
secure
the
opportunity
he
wished
for
,
by
simple
and
natural
means
,
and
land
on
the
island
without
incurring
any
suspicion
.
He
ascended
into
grottos
paved
with
emeralds
,
with
panels
of
rubies
,
and
the
roof
glowing
with
diamond
<UNK>
.
All
was
useless
,
the
treasure
disappeared
,
and
had
again
reverted
to
the
<UNK>
from
whom
for
a
moment
he
had
hoped
to
carry
it
off
.
The
old
patron
did
not
interfere
,
for
he
too
had
recognized
the
superiority
of
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
over
the
crew
and
himself
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
told
them
that
all
hands
might
turn
in
,
and
he
would
take
the
helm
.
Now
this
solitude
was
peopled
with
his
thoughts
,
the
night
lighted
up
by
his
illusions
,
and
the
silence
animated
by
his
anticipations
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
resigned
the
lugger
to
the
master
's
care
,
and
went
and
lay
down
in
his
<UNK>
;
but
,
in
spite
of
a
sleepless
night
,
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
for
a
moment
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
ordered
the
<UNK>
to
put
down
his
helm
,
in
order
to
leave
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<UNK>
,
as
he
knew
that
he
should
<UNK>
his
course
by
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
knots
.
Night
came
,
and
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
they
anchored
.
It
was
dark
,
but
at
eleven
o'clock
the
moon
rose
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
,
whose
every
wave
she
silvered
,
and
then
,
``
ascending
high
,
''
played
in
floods
of
pale
light
on
the
rocky
hills
of
this
second
<UNK>
.
``
Where
shall
we
pass
the
night
?
''
``
What
grottos
?
''
``
What
,
are
there
no
grottos
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
The
point
was
,
then
,
to
discover
the
hidden
entrance
.
Then
the
landing
began
.
However
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
insisted
on
following
him
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
oppose
this
,
fearing
if
he
did
so
that
he
might
incur
distrust
.
Having
reached
the
summit
of
a
rock
,
he
saw
,
a
<NUMBER>
feet
beneath
him
,
his
companions
,
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
rejoined
,
and
who
were
all
busy
preparing
the
repast
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
skill
as
a
<UNK>
had
augmented
with
a
capital
dish
.
Yet
perchance
to-morrow
deception
will
so
act
on
me
,
that
I
shall
,
on
compulsion
,
consider
such
a
contemptible
possession
as
the
utmost
happiness
.
Besides
,
it
were
better
to
die
than
to
continue
to
lead
this
low
and
wretched
life
.
''
<UNK>
along
the
shore
,
and
examining
the
smallest
object
with
serious
attention
,
he
thought
he
could
trace
,
on
certain
rocks
,
marks
made
by
the
hand
of
man
.
The
sight
of
marks
renewed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
hopes
.
and
had
the
dark
and
<UNK>
island
indeed
faithfully
guarded
its
precious
secret
?
Meanwhile
his
comrades
had
prepared
the
repast
,
had
got
some
water
from
a
spring
,
spread
out
the
fruit
and
bread
,
and
cooked
the
kid
.
They
all
rushed
towards
him
,
for
all
loved
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
spite
of
his
superiority
;
yet
<PROPER_NOUN>
reached
him
first
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
his

complained
of
great
pain
in
his

a
feeling

The

did
not
require
much
urging

But
,
instead

growing
easier
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
pains
appeared
to
increase
in
violence

``
No

,
and
we
must
not
leave
him
.
We
will
not
go
till
evening
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
to
the
patron
,
``
I
was
awkward
,
and
it
is
just
that
I
pay
the
penalty
of
my
<UNK>
.
The
patron
turned
towards
his
vessel
,
which
was
rolling
on
the
swell
in
the
little
harbor
,
and
,
with
sails
partly
set
,
would
be
ready
for
sea
when
her
toilet
should
be
completed
.
``
Go
,
go
!
''
I
will
pay
<NUMBER>
piastres
for
my
passage
back
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Do
you
go
,
and
I
will
stay
and
take
care
of
the
wounded

.
''
A
day
or
<NUMBER>
of
rest
will
set
me
up
,
and
I
hope
I
shall
find
among
the
rocks
certain
herbs
most
excellent
for

''
Then
he
dragged
himself
cautiously
to
the
top
of
a
rock
,
from
which
he
had
a
full
view
of
the
sea
,
and
thence
he
saw
the
tartan
complete
her
preparations
for
sailing
,
weigh
anchor
,
and
,
balancing
herself
as
gracefully
as
a
<UNK>
ere
it
takes
to
the
wing
,
set
sail
.
The
sun
had
nearly
reached
the
<UNK>
,
and
his
scorching
rays
fell
full
on
the
rocks
,
which
seemed
themselves
sensible
of
the
heat
.
He
felt
an
indescribable
sensation
somewhat
<UNK>
to
dread
-
that
dread
of
the
daylight
which
even
in
the
desert
makes
us
fear
we
are
watched
and
observed
.
The
first
was
just
disappearing
in
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
the
other
,
following
an
opposite
direction
,
was
about
to
round
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
he
descended
with
cautious
and
slow
step
,
for
he
dreaded
lest
an
accident
similar
to
that
he
had
so
<UNK>
feigned
should
happen
in
reality
.
Then
following
the
clew
that
,
in
the
hands
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
been
so
skilfully
used
to
guide
him
through
the
<UNK>
labyrinth
of
<UNK>
,
he
thought
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
anxious
not
to
be
watched
,
had
entered
the
creek
,
concealed
his
little
<UNK>
,
followed
the
line
marked
by
the
<UNK>
in
the
rock
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
had
buried
his
treasure
.
Suddenly
an
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
.
A
large
stone
had
served
as
a
<UNK>
;
<UNK>
and
pebbles
had
been
inserted
around
it
,
so
as
to
conceal
the
orifice
;
this
species
of
<UNK>
had
been
covered
with
earth
,
and
grass
and
weeds
had
grown
there
,
moss
had
clung
to
the
stones
,
<UNK>
had
taken
root
,
and
the
old
rock
seemed
fixed
to
the
earth
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
and
cut
the
strongest
<UNK>
he
could
find
,
stripped
off
its
branches
,
inserted
it
in
the
hole
,
and
used
it
as
a
lever
.
He
cast
his
eyes
around
,
and
saw
the
<UNK>
full
of
powder
which
his
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
him
.
The
explosion
soon
followed
;
the
upper
rock
was
lifted
from
its
base
by
the
terrific
force
of
the
powder
;
the
lower
<NUMBER>
flew
into
pieces
;
thousands
of
insects
escaped
from
the
aperture
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
previously
formed
,
and
a
huge
snake
,
like
the
guardian
demon
of
the
treasure
,
rolled
himself
along
in
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
and
disappeared
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
redoubled
his
efforts
;
he
seemed
like
<NUMBER>
of
the
ancient
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
who
<UNK>
the
mountains
to
<UNK>
against
the
father
of
the
gods
.
He
would
fain
have
continued
,
but
his
knees
trembled
,
and
his
heart
beat
so
violently
,
and
his
sight
became
so
dim
,
that
he
was
forced
to
pause
.
Dantes
turned
pale
,
hesitated
,
and
reflected
.
What
,
then
,
would
be
the
use
of
all
I
have
suffered
?
``
Now
that
I
expect
nothing
,
now
that
I
no
longer
entertain
the
slightest
hopes
,
the
end
of
this
adventure
becomes
simply
a
matter
of
curiosity
.
''
Yes
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
been
here
,
a
torch
in
<NUMBER>
hand
,
a
sword
in
the
other
,
and
within
<NUMBER>
paces
,
at
the
foot
of
this
rock
,
perhaps
<NUMBER>
guards
kept
watch
on
land
and
sea
,
while
their
master
descended
,
as
I
am
about
to
descend
,
<UNK>
the
darkness
before
his
<UNK>
progress
.
''
``
Yet
,
had
he
come
,
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
he
would
have
found
the
treasure
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
who
compared
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
an
<UNK>
,
which
he
could
devour
leaf
by
leaf
,
knew
too
well
the
value
of
time
to
waste
it
in
replacing
this
rock
.
After
having
stood
a
few
minutes
in
the
cavern
,
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
rather
warm
than
damp
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
eye
,
habituated
as
it
was
to
darkness
,
could
pierce
even
to
the
remotest
angles
of
the
cavern
,
which
was
of
granite
that
sparkled
like
diamonds
.
He
had
only
found
the
first
grotto
;
he
had
now
to
seek
the
second
.
At
last
it
seemed
to
him
that
<NUMBER>
part
of
the
wall
gave
forth
a
more
hollow
and
deeper
echo
;
he
eagerly
advanced
,
and
with
the
quickness
of
perception
that
no
one
but
a
prisoner
possesses
,
saw
that
there
,
in
all
probability
,
the
opening
must
be
.
As
he
struck
the
wall
,
pieces
of
<UNK>
similar
to
that
used
in
the
ground
work
of
arabesques
broke
off
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
<UNK>
,
exposing
a
large
white
stone
.
But
by
some
strange
play
of
emotion
,
in
proportion
as
the
proofs
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
not
been
deceived
became
stronger
,
so
did
his
heart
give
way
,
and
a
feeling
of
discouragement
stole
over
him
.
The
pickaxe
that
had
seemed
so
heavy
,
was
now
like
a
feather
in
his
grasp
;
he
seized
it
,
and
attacked
the
wall
.
At
last
,
after
renewed
hesitation
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
the
second
grotto
.
But
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
eye
there
was
no
darkness
.
He
advanced
towards
the
angle
,
and
summoning
all
his
resolution
,
attacked
the
ground
with
the
pickaxe
.
He
again
struck
his
pickaxe
into
the
earth
,
and
encountered
the
same
resistance
,
but
not
the
same
sound
.
This
would
have
been
a
favorable
occasion
to
secure
his
dinner
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
feared
lest
the
report
of
his
gun
should
attract
attention
.
and
now
,
with
the
aid
of
the
torch
,
saw
that
his
pickaxe
had
in
reality
struck
against
iron
and
wood
.
In
an
instant
he
had
cleared
every
obstacle
away
,
and
he
saw
successively
the
lock
,
placed
between
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
and
the
<NUMBER>
handles
at
each
end
,
all
carved
as
things
were
carved
at
that
epoch
,
when
art
rendered
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
precious
.
The
hinges
yielded
in
their
turn
and
fell
,
still
holding
in
their
grasp
fragments
of
the
wood
,
and
the
chest
was
open
.
In
the
first
,
<UNK>
piles
of
golden
coin
;
in
the
second
,
were
ranged
bars
of
<UNK>
gold
,
which
possessed
nothing
attractive
save
their
value
;
in
the
third
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
grasped
handfuls
of
diamonds
,
pearls
,
and
rubies
,
which
,
as
they
fell
on
<NUMBER>
another
,
sounded
like
hail
against
glass
.
He
would
fain
have
gazed
upon
his
gold
,
and
yet
he
had
not
strength
enough
;
for
an
instant
he
leaned
his
head
in
his
hands
as
if
to
prevent
his
senses
from
leaving
him
,
and
then
rushed
madly
about
the
rocks
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
terrifying
the
wild
goats
and
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
with
his
wild
cries
and
gestures
;
then
he
returned
,
and
,
still
unable
to
believe
the
evidence
of
his
senses
,
rushed
into
the
grotto
,
and
found
himself
before
this
mine
of
gold
and
jewels
.
There
were
a
<NUMBER>
ingots
of
gold
,
each
weighing
from
<NUMBER>
to
<NUMBER>
pounds
;
then
he
piled
up
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
crowns
,
each
worth
about
<NUMBER>
francs
of
our
money
,
and
bearing
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
piece
of
biscuit
and
a
small
quantity
of
rum
formed
his
supper
,
and
he
snatched
a
few
hours
'
sleep
,
lying
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
Again
he
climbed
the
rocky
height
he
had
ascended
the
previous
evening
,
and
strained
his
view
to
catch
every
peculiarity
of
the
<UNK>
;
but
it
wore
the
same
wild
,
barren
aspect
when
seen
by
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
which
it
had
done
when
surveyed
by
the
<UNK>
glimmer
of
eve
.
On
the
sixth
day
,
the
smugglers
returned
.
This
obliged
them
to
make
all
the
speed
they
could
to
evade
the
enemy
,
when
they
could
but
<UNK>
the
absence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
superior
skill
in
the
management
of
a
vessel
would
have
availed
them
so
<UNK>
.
Arrived
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
repaired
to
the
house
of
a
Jew
,
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
,
to
whom
he
disposed
of
<NUMBER>
of
his
smallest
diamonds
for
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
each
.
The
superior
education
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
an
air
of
such
extreme
probability
to
this
statement
that
it
never
once
occurred
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
doubt
its
accuracy
.
To
the
captain
he
promised
to
write
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
plans
.
The
proposal
was
too
advantageous
to
be
refused
,
the
more
so
as
the
person
for
whom
the
yacht
was
intended
had
gone
upon
a
tour
through
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
was
not
expected
back
in
less
than
<NUMBER>
weeks
or
a
month
,
by
which
time
the
builder
reckoned
upon
being
able
to
complete
another
.
The
builder
cheerfully
undertook
the
commission
,
and
promised
to
have
these
secret
places
completed
by
the
next
day
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
furnishing
the
dimensions
and
plan
in
accordance
with
which
they
were
to
be
constructed
.
The
spectators
followed
the
little
vessel
with
their
eyes
as
long
as
it
remained
visible
;
they
then
turned
their
conjectures
upon
her
probable
destination
.
The
island
was
utterly
deserted
,
and
bore
no
evidence
of
having
been
visited
since
he
went
away
;
his
treasure
was
just
as
he
had
left
it
.
The
former
<PROPER_NOUN>
proposed
to
augment
,
the
latter
to
remedy
.
His
signal
was
returned
,
and
in
<NUMBER>
hours
afterwards
the
newcomer
lay
at
anchor
beside
the
yacht
.
In
a
couple
of
hours
he
returned
.
There
were
,
besides
,
other
particulars
he
was
desirous
of
ascertaining
,
and
those
were
of
a
nature
he
alone
could
investigate
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
himself
.
The
first
person
to
attract
the
attention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
landed
on
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
crew
belonging
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
instantly
turned
to
meet
him
.
So
extreme
was
the
surprise
of
the
sailor
,
that
he
was
unable
even
to
thank
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
receding
figure
he
continued
to
gaze
after
in
speechless
astonishment
.
And
thus
he
proceeded
onwards
till
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
whence
a
full
view
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
obtained
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
against
the
tree
,
he
gazed
thoughtfully
for
a
time
at
the
upper
stories
of
the
shabby
little
house
.
Nothing
in
the
<NUMBER>
small
chambers
forming
the
apartments
remained
as
it
had
been
in
the
time
of
the
elder
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
the
very
paper
was
different
,
while
the
articles
of
<UNK>
furniture
with
which
the
rooms
had
been
filled
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
time
had
all
disappeared
;
the
<NUMBER>
walls
alone
remained
as
he
had
left
them
.
As
<PROPER_NOUN>
passed
the
door
on
the
fourth
floor
,
he
paused
to
inquire
whether
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
tailor
still
dwelt
there
;
but
he
received
,
for
reply
,
that
the
person
in
question
had
got
into
difficulties
,
and
at
the
present
time
kept
a
small
inn
on
the
route
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
what
raised
public
astonishment
to
a
<UNK>
,
and
set
all
<UNK>
at
defiance
,
was
the
knowledge
that
the
same
stranger
who
had
in
the
morning
visited
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
seen
in
the
evening
walking
in
the
little
village
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
and
afterwards
observed
to
enter
a
poor
fisherman
's
hut
,
and
to
pass
more
than
an
hour
in
inquiring
after
persons
who
had
either
been
dead
or
gone
away
for
more
than
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
.
This
modern
place
of
entertainment
stood
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
post
road
,
and
<UNK>
upon
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
the
surrounding
plain
,
which
more
resembled
a
dusty
lake
than
solid
ground
,
were
scattered
a
few
miserable
<UNK>
of
wheat
,
the
effect
,
no
doubt
,
of
a
curious
desire
on
the
part
of
the
<UNK>
of
the
country
to
see
whether
such
a
thing
as
the
raising
of
grain
in
those
parched
regions
was
practicable
.
And
,
as
though
to
add
to
the
daily
misery
which
this
prosperous
canal
inflicted
on
the
unfortunate
inn-keeper
,
whose
utter
ruin
it
was
fast
accomplishing
,
it
was
situated
between
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
which
it
had
its
source
and
the
<UNK>
it
had
<UNK>
,
not
a
<NUMBER>
steps
from
the
inn
,
of
which
we
have
given
a
brief
but
faithful
description
.
His
wife
,
on
the
contrary
,
whose
maiden
name
had
been
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
pale
,
meagre
,
and
<UNK>
.
The
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
bestowed
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
the
fact
that
she
had
been
born
in
a
village
,
so
called
,
situated
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
as
a
custom
existed
among
the
inhabitants
of
that
part
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
lived
of
<UNK>
every
person
by
some
particular
and
distinctive
appellation
,
her
husband
had
bestowed
on
her
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
place
of
her
sweet
and
<UNK>
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
his
rude
<UNK>
language
would
not
have
enabled
him
to
pronounce
.
He
dressed
in
the
picturesque
costume
worn
upon
grand
occasions
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
south
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
bearing
equal
resemblance
to
the
style
adopted
both
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
displayed
the
charming
fashion
prevalent
among
the
women
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
mode
of
attire
borrowed
equally
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
There
it
lay
stretching
out
into
<NUMBER>
interminable
line
of
dust
and
sand
,
with
its
sides
bordered
by
tall
,
meagre
trees
,
altogether
presenting
so
<UNK>
an
appearance
,
that
no
one
in
his
senses
could
have
imagined
that
any
traveller
,
at
liberty
to
regulate
his
hours
for
<UNK>

Having
arrived
before
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
horse
stopped
,
but
whether
for
his
own
pleasure
or
that
of
his
rider
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
.
At
that
moment
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
descending
the
wooden
staircase
that
led
from
the
upper
floor
,
and
,
with
many
bows
and
courteous
smiles
,
mine
host
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
besought
his
guest
to
enter

Pray
do
n't
heed
him
,
sir
!
I
really
did
not
observe
whom
I
had
the
honor
to
receive
under
my
poor
roof
.
The
priest
gazed
on
the
person
addressing
him
with
a
long
and
searching
gaze
-
there
even
seemed
a
disposition
on
his
part
to
court
a
similar
scrutiny
on
the
part
of
the
inn-keeper
;
then
,
observing
in
the
countenance
of
the
latter
no
other
expression
than
extreme
surprise
at
his
own
want
of
attention
to
an
inquiry
so
courteously
<UNK>
,
he
deemed
it
as
well
to
terminate
this
dumb
show
,
and
therefore
said
,
speaking
with
a
strong
Italian
accent
,
``
You
are

presume

It
is
so

at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
really
I
believe
that
the

will
in

go
without
any
<UNK>
whatever
.
Upon
issuing
forth
from
his
subterranean
retreat
at
the
expiration
of
<NUMBER>
minutes
,
he
found
the
abbe
seated
upon
a
wooden
stool
,
leaning
his

on
a
table
,
while

,
whose
animosity
seemed
appeased
by
the
unusual
command
of
the
traveller
for
refreshments
,
had
crept
up
to
him
,
and
had
established
himself
very
comfortably
between
his

,
his
long

<UNK>
neck
resting
on
his

while
his
dim
eye
was
fixed
earnestly
on

face

``
Yes

continued
the

<UNK>
the

gaze
;

continued
he
significantly
,
with

on

shaking
his

,
``

fixed
on

with

;

drawing
forth
from

<PROPER_NOUN>
muttered
a

So

drew
the

opened

contrived

<PROPER_NOUN>

rising

descending

As

go
towards

as
though
to

Caderousse

exchanged

through

From

It

waved

told

all

The

As

<PROPER_NOUN>
met

Perhaps

She

the

only
raised

After

usually
went
out

read

this

The

not

In

The

The

looked

``

During

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
entered

He

This

It

The

uttered
a

he

This

greatly
the

happiness

But
there

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened

closed

crossing

went

pointed
with

``

What

he
say

``

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
All

Then
extending
his

towards
<NUMBER>
of
the
pistols
,
he
said
,
``
There

A

ran
through
the
young
man

frame

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about

caught
him
in

were
pressed
against

made
no

he
made

went
into

and
seated
himself

He
was
still
<UNK>
young

he

surrounded

Then

At

he
could
not

make
out
what

was
,
and
fearing
to
excite
the
mirth
of
the
sailors
by
mistaking
a
floating
cloud
for
land
,
he
remained
silent
;
suddenly
a
great
light
appeared
on
the
strand
;
land
might
resemble

but
the
fire
was
not

said
the

;
``

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
repeating

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
fixing

on

The

again
changed
the
course
of
the

,
which
rapidly
approached
the
island
,
and
was
soon
within

As

he
examined

On

he
was
about

without

than
these

on
an

Not

in

this

it

observed

The

did

wait
for

invitation
;
<NUMBER>
strokes
of
the

brought
them
to

;
<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang

The

He

he

despatched

All
the

the

in

the

,
pointing

``
He

situated
between

and
the

he
was
born
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
entered
the

service
when
he
was
<NUMBER>

his

who
owned
a

and
lived
by
the
wool
and
the
<UNK>
,
which
he
sold
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Every
day
<PROPER_NOUN>
led
his
flock
to
<UNK>
on
the
road
that
leads
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
every
day
,
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
priest
and
the
boy
sat
down
on
a
bank
by
the
<UNK>
,
and
the
little
shepherd
took
his
lesson
out
of
the
priest
's
breviary
.
The

evening
,
when
the
flock
was
safe
at
the
farm
,
the
little
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastened
to
the
<UNK>
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
took
a
large
nail
,
heated
and
sharpened
it
,
and
formed
a
sort
of
<UNK>
.
This
demanded
new
effort
,
but
nothing
compared
to
the
first
;
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
wrote
as
well
with
this
pen
as
with
the
<UNK>
.
Then
,
with
his
knife
,
he
began
to
<UNK>
all
sorts
of
objects
in
wood
;
it
was
thus
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
famous

Vampa
was
<NUMBER>

<PROPER_NOUN>
eleven

His
disposition

always
inclined
to
exact
<UNK>
rather

-RRB-
kept
him
<UNK>
from

So
that
,
thanks
to
her

's
generosity
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
most
beautiful
and
the
<UNK>
peasant
near
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
,
when
they
had
thus
passed
the
day
in
building
castles
in

,
they
separated
their
flocks
,
and
descended
from
the
elevation
of
their
dreams
to
the
reality
of
their
humble
position
.
This
,
however
,
was
nothing
to
a
sculptor
like
Vampa
;
he
examined
the
broken
stock
,
calculated
what
change
it
would
require
to
<UNK>
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
and
made
a
fresh
stock
,
so
beautifully
carved
that
it
would
have
fetched
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
piastres
,
had
he
chosen
to
sell
it
.
From
this
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
devoted
all
his
leisure
time
to
<UNK>
himself
in
the
use
of
his
precious
weapon
;
he
purchased
powder
and
ball
,
and
everything
served
him
for
a
mark
-
the
trunk
of
some

<UNK>
<UNK>

that
grew
on

the

on

the

that
<UNK>
above
their

:
and
thus
he
soon
became
so
expert
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
overcame
the
terror
she
at
first
felt
at
the
report
,
and
amused
herself
by
watching
him
direct
the
ball
wherever
he
pleased
,
with
as
much
accuracy
as
if

placed
it
by

The

threw

sobbing
like

When

An

<PROPER_NOUN>
aroused

The

trembled
very

<PROPER_NOUN>
reassured
her
with

tapping

he

When

Instantly

The

was
an
entire
stranger
to
him
,
but
not
so
the
other
;
and
though
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
unable
to
distinguish
his
features
,
from
his
being
either
wrapped
in
his
mantle
or
obscured
by
the
shadow
,
the
tones
of
his
voice
had
made
too
powerful
an
impression
on
him
the
first
time
he
had
heard
them
for
him
ever
again
to
forget
them
,
hear
them
when
or
where
he
might
.
As
we
have
seen
,
therefore
,
he
permitted
his
former
host
to
retire
without
attempting
a
recognition
,
but
fully
promising
himself
a
rich
<UNK>
for
his
present
forbearance
should
chance
afford
him
another
opportunity
.
Like
a
genuine
Frenchman
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
employed
his
time
in
arranging
for
the
evening
's
diversion
;
he
had
sent
to
engage
a
box
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
having
a
number
of
letters
to
write
,
relinquished
the
carriage
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
the
whole
of
the
day
.
The
opera
of
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
''
was
announced
for
representation
,
and
the
principal
actors
were
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Sometimes
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
affect
to
make
a
joke
of
his
want
of
success
;
but
<UNK>
he
was
deeply
wounded
,
and
his
self-love
immensely
piqued
,
to
think
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
most
admired
and
most
sought
after
of
any
young
person
of
his
day
,
should
thus
be
passed
over
,
and
merely
have
his
labor
for
his
pains
.
Yet
he
could
not
restrain
a
hope
that
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
elsewhere
,
there
might
be
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
commence
on
the
morrow
;
therefore
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
an
instant
to
lose
in
setting
forth
the
programme
of
his
hopes
,
expectations
,
and
claims
to
notice
.
These
united
considerations
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
more
lively
and
anxious
to
please
than
he
had
hitherto
been
.
Towards
the
close
of
the
first
act
,
the
door
of
a
box
which
had
been
hitherto
vacant
was
opened
;
a
lady
entered
to
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
introduced
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
indeed
,
he
had
imagined
she
still
was
.
And
such
magnificent
hair
!
``
Ah
,
I
know
her
by
name
!
''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
you
seem
to
be
on
excellent
terms
with
the
beautiful
countess
.
''
``
No
;
of
taste
,
''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
gravely
.
``
I
was
.
''
All
I
can
say
is
,
if
ever
I
should
get
such
a
chance
,
the
living
should
be
my
theme
.
''
``
Certainly
,
directly
the
curtain
falls
on
the
stage
.
''
How
exquisitely
<UNK>
<UNK>
his
part
.
''
``
Why
,
you
know
,
my
dear
fellow
,
when
one
has
been
accustomed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
such
singers
as
these
do
n't
make
the
same
impression
on
you
they
perhaps
do
on
others

''
The
curtain
at
length
fell
on
the
<UNK>
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
seized
his
hat
,
rapidly
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
,
arranged
his
cravat
and
<UNK>
,
and
signified
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
was
waiting
for
him
to
lead
the
way
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
distinguished
young
men
of
the
day
,
both
as
regarded
his
position
in
society
and
extraordinary
talents
;
nor
did
he
say
more
than
the
truth
,
for
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
circle
in
which
the
viscount
moved
,
he
was
looked
upon
and
<UNK>
as
a
model
of
perfection
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
how
completely
he
was
in
his
element
;
and
,
unwilling
to
interfere
with
the
pleasure
he
so
evidently
felt
,
took
up
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
glass
,
and
began
in
his
turn
to
survey
the
audience
.
``
All
I
can
tell
about
her
,
''
replied
the
countess
,
``
is
,
that
she
has
been
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
since
the
beginning
of
the
season
;
for
I
saw
her
where
she
now
<UNK>
the
very
first
night
of
the
season
,
and
since
then
she
has
never
missed
a
performance
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
countess
exchanged
a
smile
,
and
then
the
latter
resumed
her
conversation
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
to
his
previous
survey
of
the
house
and
company
.
The
ballet
at
length
came
to
a
close
,
and
the
curtain
fell
amid
the
loud
,
unanimous
<UNK>
of
an
enthusiastic
and
delighted
audience
.
The
curtain
rose
,
and
the
attention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
attracted
by
the
actors
;
and
his
eyes
turned
from
the
box
containing
the
Greek
girl
and
her
strange
companion
to
watch
the
business
of
the
stage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
now
listened
to
it
for
the
third
time
;
yet
it
's
notes
,
so
tenderly
expressive
and
fearfully
grand
as
the
wretched
husband
and
wife
give
vent
to
their
different
griefs
and
passions
,
<UNK>
through
the
soul
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
an
effect
equal
to
his
first
emotions
upon
hearing
it
.
The
surprise
and
agitation
occasioned
by
this
full
confirmation
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
former
suspicion
had
no
doubt
imparted
a
corresponding
expression
to
his
features
;
for
the
countess
,
after
gazing
with
a
puzzled
look
at
his
face
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
and
begged
to
know
what
had
happened
.
``
What
a
question
-
so
truly
French
!
How
ghastly
pale
he
is
!
''
``
Oh
,
pray
do

for

all
about

a

''
``
Well
.
''
``
I
must
positively
find
out
who

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rising
from
his
seat
.
<UL>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
of
course
:
``
The
son
of
an
<UNK>
sire

and
the
father

a

more
unfortunate

bore
in
his
looks
that
cast
of
inauspicious
melancholy
by
which
the
<UNK>
of
that
time
pretended
to
distinguish
those
who
were
<UNK>
to
a
violent

unhappy
death

``
I
'll
tell

answered
the

The

hair

large
bright

glittering
eyes
,
in
which
a
wild

unearthly
fire
seems
burning

the

ghastly
paleness

No

she
belongs
to
the

horrible
race
he
does
,
and
is
,
like
himself
,
a
dealer
in
magical
arts

``
Listen
to
me
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
and
do
not
be
so
very
headstrong

There
was
nothing

left
for

to
do

to
take
up
his
hat
,
open
the
door
of

and
offer
the

his

.
``

said
the

,
in
reply
to
her
companion
's
<UNK>
observation
on
the
subject
;
``

that

the

quitted

leaving
him
unable

decide
whether

herself
at

During

inquired

They
resolved
to

ordered

they
descended

placed

He
had
recognized
by
certain
<UNK>
signs

that
his

belonged
to
the
aristocracy

<PROPER_NOUN>
let
himself
be
pressed
just
as
long
as
friendship
required

and
then
<UNK>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
would
do
him
a
great
favor
by
allowing
him
to
occupy
the
carriage
alone
the
next
day

He
therefore
promised
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
would
content
himself
the
morrow
with
witnessing
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
the
windows
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
nothing
doubted
but
that
the
fair
unknown
would
reply
in
the

manner
.
``
She
has
answered
you

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
letter
,
and
read
:
-

evening
,
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
descend
from
your
carriage
opposite
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
follow
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
peasant
who
<UNK>
your
torch
from
you
.
``
Well
,
''
asked
he
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
finished
,
``
what
do
you
think
of
that

''
``
Take
care

said

``
Yes

``
Well

read

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
as

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
am
in

''
I
adore
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
I
have
always
had
a
great
taste
for
<UNK>
.
''
He
hastened
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
seat
himself
,
free
to
recommence
the
discussion
after
dinner
.
He
had
started
the
previous
evening
,
and
had
only
returned
an
hour
since
.
The
count
must
feel
sure
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
recognized
him
;
and
yet
he
had
not
let
fall
a
single
word
<UNK>
any
previous
acquaintance
between
them
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
some
difficulty
,
<UNK>
their
fear
of
depriving
him
of
it
;
but
the
count
replied
that
,
as
he
was
going
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
box
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
he
lost

they
did
not
profit
by
it

Truly
,
a
<UNK>
hero
!
He
was
at
least
<NUMBER>
;
and
yet
it
was
easy
to
understand
that
he
was
formed
to
rule
the
young
men
with
whom
he
associated
at
present
.
He
thought
several
times
of
the
project
the
count
had
of
visiting
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
,
with
his
eccentric
character
,
his
characteristic
face
,
and
his
colossal
fortune
,
he
would
produce
a
great
effect
there
.
As
similar
intrigues
are
not
uncommon
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
if
we
may
credit
travellers
,
the
<UNK>
did
not
manifest
the
least
incredulity
,
but
congratulated
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
his
success
.
On
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
theatres
open
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
as
<UNK>
begins
after
<NUMBER>
at
night
.
The
author
of
this
history
,
who
has
resided
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
does
not
recollect
to
have
ever
seen
a
ceremony
interrupted
by
<NUMBER>
of
those
events
so
common
in
other
countries
.
As
the
day
advanced
,
the
tumult
became
greater
.
The
races
,
like
the
moccoli
,
are
<NUMBER>
of
the
<UNK>
peculiar
to
the
last
days
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
detachment
of
carbineers
,
<NUMBER>
abreast
,
galloped
up
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
order
to
clear
it
for
the
<UNK>
.
Immediately
,
without
any
other
signal
,
the
carriages
moved
on
,
flowing
on
towards
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
down
all
the
streets
,
like
<UNK>
<UNK>
up
for
a
while
,
which
again
flow
into
the
parent
river
;
and
the
immense
stream
again
continued
its
course
between
its
<NUMBER>
granite
banks
.
The
moccoletto
is
like
life
:
man
has
found
but
<NUMBER>
means
of
<UNK>
it
,
and
that
<NUMBER>
comes
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
-
the
gigantic
<UNK>
,
the
monstrous
<UNK>
,
the
superhuman
<UNK>
.
It
was
a
signal
.
Suppose
that
all
the
stars
had
descended
from
the
sky
and
mingled
in
a
wild
dance
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
the
whole
accompanied
by
cries
that
were
never
heard
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
.
Every
<NUMBER>
minutes
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
out
his
watch
;
at
length
it
pointed
to
<NUMBER>
.
The
steps
were
crowded
with
masks
,
who
strove
to
snatch
each
other
's
torches
.
He
watched
them
pass
through
the
crowd
for
some
time
,
but
at
length
he
lost
sight
of
them
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
No
sound
was
audible
save
that
of
the
carriages
that
were
carrying
the
<UNK>
home
;
nothing
was
visible
save
a
few
lights
that
burnt
behind
the
windows
.
By
a
chance
,
which
added
yet
more
to
the
intensity
of
the
darkness
,
the
moon
,
which
was
on
the
<UNK>
,
did
not
rise
until
eleven
o'clock
,
and
the
streets
which
the
young
man
traversed
were
plunged
in
the
deepest
obscurity
.
The
sudden
<UNK>
of
the
moccoletti
,
the
darkness
which
had
replaced
the
light
,
and
the
silence
which
had
succeeded
the
<UNK>
,
had
left
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mind
a
certain
depression
which
was
not
free
from
uneasiness
.
At
eleven
o'clock
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
come
back
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
that
he
had
left
him
at
the
moment
they
were
about
to
extinguish
the
moccoli
,
and
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

you
know

went

had
just
arrived

and
was
leaning

He
had
sent
away
his

with
orders
for

to
fetch
him
at

;
fortunately
the

He
went
up
to
him
,
but
,
to
his
extreme
astonishment
,
the
stranger
first
addressed
him
.
``

``

On

responded

went

by

glided

Behind

a

The

himself

however

saw
his

more
plainly
in
proportion
as
he
went
on
towards
the
light

which
served
in
some
manner
as
a

A

placed
at

lighted
up
with

flickering

the

At

silent

scarcely

like

was
a

who
was
walking
up

down
before

was
only

because
in

seemed
more

At
this
challenge
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
quickly
,
drawing
at
the

a
pistol
from
his
girdle
.
``
It

the

``

Then
,
by

similar

On

bowed

asked

he
lighted

The

said

I
crossed

at

by

I
had
once

looked
into
the

The

was
long

;
a

extended
down

at

were

that

The

the

I

curiosity

The

,
meanwhile

was
humming
a

as

stood
<UNK>
his

at
the
fire
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
kindled
to
dry

this

she

occupied

in

by
spreading
a

at

and
placing
on
it
the

to

added
<NUMBER>

<UNK>
eggs

And

`
Then
it

I

'
remarked
the

.
`
There
,
there
,
'
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
`
do

hear
that

He
sighed
heavily
.
Had
the
unhappy
man
on
whom
she
<UNK>
her
<UNK>
been
previously
acquainted
with
her
,
so
sudden
an
alteration
might
well
have
excited
suspicion
in
his

,
or
at

have
greatly
astonished
him
.
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastily
shut
the
door
and
returned
to
his
guest
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
lighted
a
candle
by
the
<UNK>
ashes
that
<UNK>
on
the
hearth
.
The
quick

eager
glance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
him
as
he
ascended
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
contrary
,
turned
his
back
,
and
seemed
most
anxiously
to
avoid
even
glancing
at
him
.
I
looked
into
the
kitchen
once
more
and
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
long
table
upon
<NUMBER>
of
the
low
wooden
stools
which
in
country
places
are
frequently
used
instead
of
chairs
;
his
back
was
turned
towards
me
,
so
that
I
could
not
see
the
expression
of
his
countenance
-
neither
should
I
have
been
able
to
do
so
had
he
been
placed
differently
,
as
his
head
was
buried
between
his
<NUMBER>
hands
.
``
Caderousse
shuddered
.
<UNK>
and
tottering
footsteps
resounded
across
the
chamber
above
me
,
and
the
next
instant
a
dull
,
heavy
weight
seemed
to
fall
powerless
on
the
staircase
.
``
To
the
fearful
noises
that
had
awakened
me
had
succeeded
the
most
perfect
silence

<UNK>
,
save
by
the
footsteps
of
a
man
walking
about
in
the
chamber
above
.
A
moment
later
he
came
down
again
,
holding
in
his
hand
the
small
shagreen
case
,
which
he
opened
,
to
assure
himself
it
contained
the
diamond
,
-
seemed
to
hesitate
as
to
which
pocket
he
should
put
it
in
,
then
,
as
if
dissatisfied
with
the
security
of
either
pocket
,
he
deposited
it
in
his
red
handkerchief
,
which
he
carefully
rolled
round
his
head
.
For
this
purpose
I
applied
all
the
strength
I
possessed
to
force
an
entrance
from
the
cramped
spot
in
which
I
lay
to
the
adjoining
room
.
The
pistol
I
had
heard
had
doubtless
been
fired
at
her
.
The
furniture
had
been
knocked
over
in
the
deadly
struggle
that
had
taken
place
there
,
and
the
sheets
,
to
which
the
unfortunate
jeweller
had
doubtless
clung
,
were
dragged
across
the
room
.
This
appalling
sight
almost
<UNK>
me
of
my
senses
,
and
finding
that
I
could
no
longer
be
of
service
to
any
<NUMBER>
in
the
house
,
my
only
desire
was
to
fly
.
I
made
no
resistance
;
I
was
no

master

my

`
What
does
he
mean

'
``
Then
I
saw
that

for

they

Alas

resistance
was
far
from

my

hung

You

I
welcomed

related

exclaimed

How

he
said
,
``

you

``

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
not

Again
<PROPER_NOUN>
bit
his

;
he
saw
that
he
was
no
match
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
an
argument
of

he
therefore
hastened
to

But
as

the

I
am
charmed
to
find

that
will
spare

the
troublesome

``
And
for

the

Well

the

The

``
Is
it
possible

not
looked

``
Precisely

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

By

His
forced

sat
<UNK>
upon
him
,
and
approached
almost
to
impertinence
.
The
banker
thought
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
take
the
upper
hand
.
retorted
the
count
.
And
with
these
words
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
case
containing
his

drew
forth
<NUMBER>
orders
on
the

for
<NUMBER>

payable
at

<PROPER_NOUN>

The
blow
had
struck
home
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
entirely
vanquished
;
with
a
trembling
hand
he
took
the
<NUMBER>

from
the

who
held

carelessly
between

proceeded
to

the

that
the

it
not

<PROPER_NOUN>
in

inquired
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
an
air
of
indulgence
and
<UNK>
that
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
smile
,
acquainted
as
he
was
with
the
secrets
of
the

domestic
life
.
Her

The

the

had
then
been
left
entirely
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

It

that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

all
the

consequently
the
description

bore
the

The

shrugged

turned
towards

assumed
a

the

patted
him
gently
on

shoulder
,
his
usual
mode
of
praising
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
pleased
and
gratified
with
the
commission
assigned

,
walked
calmly
towards
a
projecting
stone
forming
the
angle

seating

began

In

availing

thus

He

He

At

I
received

states

Your

did
not

an

the

was
sent
to

He

so

and
her
devotion

had
learned

look
all
the
varied
feelings

were
passing
in
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
did

either
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
the
domestic
in

to
carry
on
with
his
father
the
strange
conversation
which
he
was
about
to
begin
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
face
remained
perfectly
passive
during
this
long
preamble
,
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
eye
was
endeavoring
to
penetrate
into
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
old
man
's
heart
.
Had
the
old
man
's
face
been
moulded
in
wax
it
could
not
have
shown
less
emotion
at
this
news
than
was
now
to
be
traced
there
.
It
is
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
desirable
connections
which
could
possibly
be
formed
;
he
possesses
fortune
,
a
high
rank
in
society

and
every
personal
<UNK>
likely
to
render
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
happy
,
-
his
name
,
moreover
,
can
not
be
wholly
unknown
to
you

The
procureur
,
who
knew
the
political
hatred
which
had
formerly
existed
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
elder
d'Epinay
,
well
understood
the
agitation
and
anger
which
the
announcement
had
produced
;
but
,
feigning
not
to
perceive
either
,
he
immediately
resumed
the
narrative
begun
by
his
wife
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
quietly
opened
a
window
,
saying
,
``
It
is
very
warm
,
and
the
heat
affects
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
such
an
effort
that
his
lips
expanded
into
a
smile
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
fully
understood
his
father
's
meaning
,
and
answered
by
a
slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
.
It
had
been
agreed
that
the
old
man
should
express
his
approbation
by
closing
his
eyes
,
his
refusal
by
winking
them
several
times
,
and
if
he
had
some
desire
or
feeling
to
express
,
he
raised
them
to
heaven
.
The
old
man
closed
his
eyes
eagerly
,
thereby
<UNK>
that
such
was
his
wish
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
grandpapa
,
''
cried
she
,
``
what
has
happened
?
Is
it
my
father
?
''
``
Me
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
closed
his
eyes
.
``
I
have
not
seen
you
all

I
do
assure
you
,
grandpapa
-
Ah
-
M.
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

just
left
this
room
,
have
they
not
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
I
go
and
ask
them
,
that
I
may
have
the
opportunity
of
making
my
peace
with
you
?
''
and
she
again
tried
to
think
what
it
could
be
.
``
I
understand
;
you
are
displeased
at
the
silence
I
have
preserved
on
the
subject
.
But
there
was
no
look
calculated
to
reassure
her
;
all
it
seemed
to
say
was
,
``
It
is
not
only
your
reserve
which
<UNK>
me
.
''
``
No

''
The
old
man
's
eyes
beamed
with
an
expression
of
gentle
affection
.
``
Yes
.
''
``
Yes
.
''
A
tear
trembled
in
the
eye
of
the
invalid
.
Ah
,
if
you
could
but
help
me
-
if
we
could
both
together
defeat
their
plan
!
At
these
words
there
appeared
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
eye
an
expression
of
such
deep
meaning
that
the
young
girl
thought
she
could
read
these
words
there
:
``
You
are
mistaken
;
I
can
still
do
much
for
you
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
eyes
,
it
was
the
sign
agreed
on
between
him
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
he
wanted
anything
.
When
she
arrived
at
that
letter
the
paralytic
made
her
understand
that
she
had
spoken
the
<UNK>
letter
of
the
thing
he
wanted
.
``
Ah
,
it
is
No
,
then
?
''
At
the
word
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
sign
to
her
to
stop
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Do
you
wish
the
notary
to
be
sent
for
immediately
?
''
``
Yes

''
``
Yes

''
demanded
he
of
the
paralytic
.
``
Do
you
wish
for
a

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
no
answer
.
``
Is
it

do
us
some
ill
turn

<PROPER_NOUN>
acknowledged
no
master
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
never
allowed
his
desires
in
any
way
to
be
contradicted
.
As
soon
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
the
room
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a
malicious
expression
that
said
many
things
.
<UNK>
of
an
hour
after
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
,
bringing
the
notary
with
him
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

said
she
,
``

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
she
,
``
the

But
before
the
notary
could
answer

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
drawn
him
aside
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
old
man
heard
this

<PROPER_NOUN>
fixed
his

so
earnestly
on

that
she
felt
bound

``

;

,
turning
to
her

she
repeated
,

The

stopped

at
the

motioned
the
invalid
.
``
What

As
to
the

it
will
not

very
much
more

you
satisfied

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
position
demanded
much
reserve
,
but
who
was
longing
to
know
what
his

intentions
were

A

words
sufficed
for
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
<NUMBER>
officers

the
law

``
Yes

Never

the
struggle

been
more
apparent
than
now
,

if
it
was
not
a

it

The

showed
that
there

something

<PROPER_NOUN>
found

a

after

need

Thus
it

pronounce

himself

shuddered

rising

ascended

Would

not
be
a

revenge
for
him
when
he
found
that

had
not
died
from
the
blow
of
his
dagger
?
I
was
without

light
in

room
;
when
the
wind
shook
all
the
doors
,
behind
which
I
continually
expected
to
see
some
spy
concealed
,
I
trembled

I
understood
that

had
nothing

that

so
I
decided
upon
descending

I
descended
the
staircase
step
by

;
the
only
thing
I
could
not
conquer
was
a

in

I
had
provided
myself
with

lantern

I
fancied
continually
that

saw

between

through

yet
the

fell
from

I
rose

again
began

the

I

pronounced

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
from
having
been
an

was
promoted
to
a

office

and
the

begged
for
<NUMBER>
days
time

ascertain
exactly
who

full

It
was
evident
that
the
abbe
limited
himself
to
objects
of
strict
necessity
.
The
other
room
near
the
library
was
a
bedroom
.
He
hired
the
apartment
in
which
he
lived
furnished
,
passed
only
a

in

there

rarely

From
the
signs
of
respect
the
valet
paid
him
,
he
saw
that
his
note
had
produced
a
good
effect
.
The
stranger
ascended
a
rough
staircase
,
and
before
a
table
,
illumined
by
a
lamp
whose
light
was
concentrated
by
a
large
shade
while
the
rest
of
the
apartment
was
in
partial
darkness
,
he
perceived
the
abbe
in
a

dress

with

with

It

induce

At
this
moment
the
abbe
pressed
down
his
side
of
the
shade
and
so
raised
it
on
the
other
,
throwing
a
bright
light
on
the
stranger

face

his

remained
obscured

what

he
recalled

kept

How

is
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
longed
intensely
for

He
shut
himself
in

tried

his

glanced
over

Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
out

with

looked
through

there

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at

fainted

was
impossible
to
wait
longer

his

throbbed
violently

his
eyes
were
growing
dim

he
passed
<NUMBER>
leg
over
the
wall
,
and
in
a

leaped
down
on
the

He
followed
a
short
distance
close
under
the
wall
,
then
crossed
a
path
,
hid
entered
a
clump
of
trees
.
A
light
moved
rapidly
from

past

So
many

had

all

formed
his

The

seeing

approach

drew
back
mechanically

until
he
found
himself
stopped
by

there

redoubled

clasping

the

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
began
again

uneasiness

did

find
the

had
given

interior

useful

he
arrived
safely
at

while

was
feeling
his

a

indicated
the

on

bathed

as

pointed
to
the

under

again

the

<UNK>

<NUMBER>
hours
passed
thus
.
It
would
be
his
bedroom
they
would
attack
,
and
they
must
reach
it
by
the
back
staircase
,
or
by
the
window
in
the
dressing-room
.
The
count
felt
his
heart
beat
more
rapidly
.
The
window
whence
the
noise
proceeded
was
opposite
the
opening
by
which
the
count
could
see
into
the
dressing-room
.
``
That
's
a
daring
rascal

whispered
the

.
said
he
,
``
there
are

There
were
<NUMBER>
doors
;
he
bolted
them
both
.
Alone
and
free
to
act
as
he
wished
,
the
man
then
drew
from
his
pocket
something
which
the
count
could
not
discern
,
placed
it
on
a
stand
,
then
went
straight
to
the
secretary
,
felt
the
lock
,
and
contrary
to
his
expectation
found
that
the
key
was
missing
.
But
the
man
in
the
dark
could
not
find
the
right
key
.
Then
he
added
some
words
in
a
low
tone
,
for
the
exclamation
which
surprise
had
drawn
from
the
count
,
faint
as
it
had
been
,
had
startled
the
man
who
remained
in
the
<UNK>
of
the
old
<UNK>
.
The
man
,
hearing
nothing
more
,
stood
erect
,
and
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<UNK>
his
disguise
had
advanced
straight
to
the
secretary
,
whose
lock
was
beginning
to
crack
under
his
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
suddenly
struck
his
finger
on
his
forehead
and
a
smile
passed
over
his
lips
;
then
drawing
near
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
whispered
,
-
``
Remain

He
turned
.
The
count
placed
himself
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
window
,
thus
cutting
off
from
the
thief
his
only
chance
of
retreat
.

The
daring
attempt
to
rob
the

was
the
topic
of
conversation
throughout
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
the
next
fortnight

The
count
told
every
<NUMBER>
that
this

had
happened
during
his
absence
at

and
that
he
only
knew
what

related

who
that

by
mere
chance

had
requested
to
pass
the

in
his
house

to
examine
some
valuable
books
in
his
library

It
was
expected
that
this
wedding
would
shortly
take
place
,
as
the
young
man
was
received
at
the
banker

as
the
betrothed

With
an
instinctive
hatred

she
suffered

attentions

get
rid
of

but
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
urged
his
suit

she
betrayed
an
entire
dislike
to
him

No
one
had
taken
up
the
remark
about
the
general

and
no
one
had
recognized

the
officer

betrayed
the
castle

<PROPER_NOUN>
the
noble
count
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
of

those
of
whom
the

inquired
always
told
him

was
out
on
a
journey
which
would
detain
him
some
days
.
He
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
pacing
the
room
;
on
perceiving
him
<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
.
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
frightfully
pale

he
endeavored

speak

the

died
on

``
Yes

<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
furiously
towards

but
the

restrained
him
more
by
a
mild
look
than
by
his
extended
hand

<PROPER_NOUN>
tottered
and
fell
overpowered
in
a
chair
.
``
Now

he
,

But
this

soon
forsook

was
succeeded

a

deliberately
;

<PROPER_NOUN>
hastened

quickly

Every

of
a

finding

all
the

of

seeing
an

were
felt
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
during
the

of
this
meeting
,
which
she
had
so
eagerly
expected

His
eye
,
<UNK>
with
happiness
,
was
reading
eagerly
the
tearful
gaze
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
.
In
fact
,
the
count
's
face
brightened
.
``
I
know
not

it
is
finished

my

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
taking
the

's
hands
;
``
but
I
do
know
you
have
nothing
more
to

''
``
By
my

he
,
extending
his
hand
over
the
head
of
the
young

,
``
I

said
he
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
he
led
the
beautiful
Greek
girl
to
a
private
staircase
.
From
that
glass
door
the
<UNK>
man
went
to
the
count
's
bedroom
and
raised
with
a
<UNK>
hand
the
curtain
of
a
window
overlooking
the
court-yard
.
The
count
's
eye
expanded
;
he
knew
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
insulted
the
count
dreadfully
,
and
that
in
every
country
in
the
world
such
an
insult
would
lead
to
a
deadly
duel
.
He
easily
understood
why
his
son
did
not
come
to
see
him
before
he
went
to
avenge
his
father
's
honor
;
but
when
that
was
done
,
why
did
not
his
son
come
and
throw
himself
into
his
arms
?
The
valet
threw
into
the
carriage
his
military
cloak
,
in
which
<NUMBER>
swords
were
wrapped
,
and
,
shutting
the
door
,
he
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
coachman
.
The
horses
bounded
beneath
the
whip
;
and
in
<NUMBER>
minutes
they
stopped
before
the
count
's
door
.
``
Ah
,
it
is
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
quietly
;
``
I
thought
I
had
not
heard
aright

asked
the
general
.
``
Yet
he
considered
you
the

on

``
But
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
coldly
,
``
I

that
it

I

in

since

it

moving
his

slightly
up

down

I

of
my

perhaps
I
may
be
more
honorable

than
you
under

The
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
dreadfully
pale
;
his
eye
seemed
to
burn
with
a
devouring
fire
.
But
you
guess
it
now
,
do
you
not
?
Then
,
with
sighs
which
were
unlike
any
human
sound
,
he
dragged
himself
to
the
door
,
reeled
across
the
court-yard
,
and
falling
into
the
arms
of
his
valet
,
he
said
in
a
voice
scarcely
intelligible
,
-

<NUMBER>
persons
were
coming
down
the
stairs
;
he
had
only
time
to
creep
into

alcove
to
avoid
them

The
words
died
away
,
the
steps
were
lost
in
the
distance
.
And
at
the
very
moment
when
the
wheels
of
that
coach
crossed
the
gateway
a
report
was
heard
,
and
a
thick

escaped
through

broken

No

the

rushing

leaned
against

returned
hastily

<PROPER_NOUN>
watched

left

he
heard
her
ascend
the

staircase
which
led
both
to

to

<PROPER_NOUN>
rang
immediately
for

From

his

chatting

his

Now

here
we
are
obliged

own
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
ought
to
have
felt
remorse

that
he
did
not

Moreover

he
reckoned
much
on

interest

to
hush
up

In
all
<UNK>
brains
,
the
<UNK>
idea
-
and
there
always
is
<NUMBER>
-
is
sure
to
be
the
last
thought
before
sleeping
,
and
the
first
upon
waking
in
the
morning
.
A
gendarme
is
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
striking
objects
in
the
world
,
even
to
a
man
void
of
uneasiness
;
but
for
<NUMBER>
who
has
a
timid
conscience
,
and
with
good
cause
too
,
the
yellow
,
blue
,
and
white
uniform
is
really
very
alarming
.
And
the
youth
dressed
himself
with
a
facility
his
valet

chambre
had
failed
to
rob
him
of
during
the
<NUMBER>
months
of
fashionable
life
he
had
led
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
appearance
of
the
third
gendarme
settled
the
matter
,
for
a
crowd
of
curious
<UNK>
was
extended
before
him
,
effectually
<UNK>
the
entrance
to
the
hotel
.
A
pallor
overspread
the
young
man
's
forehead
,
and
he
looked
around
him
with
anxiety
.
For
a
moment
he
convulsively
pressed
his
head
within
his
hands
,
and
during
that
brief
period
he
became
nearly
mad
with
terror
;
but
soon
a
ray
of
hope
<UNK>
in
the
multitude
of
thoughts
which
bewildered
his
mind
,
and
a
faint
smile
played
upon
his
white
lips
and
pallid
cheeks
.
He
then
drew
the
pin
from
his
cravat
and
placed
it
on
the
paper
.
At
daybreak
,
the
<UNK>
were
set
at
work
in
all
directions
,
and
almost
immediately
the
authorities
in
every
district
had
exerted
their
utmost
endeavors
to
arrest
the
murderer
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
young
man
,
having
dismissed
the
boy
and
horse
,
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
,
which
was
opened
,
and
again
closed
after
his
entrance
.
I
would
rather
find
it
<UNK>
bolted
.
''
He
glanced
around
,
looked
in
the
bed
,
shook
the
curtains
,
opened
the
closets
,
and
finally
stopped
at
the
chimney
.
The
fact
was
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
war
with
society
ever
since
his
youth
,
was
quite
as
deep
as
a
gendarme
,
even
though
he
were
advanced
to
the
rank
of
brigadier
,
and
quite
prepared
for
the
fire
,
he
had
climbed
out
on
the
roof
and
was
crouching
down
against
the
<UNK>
.
If
once
discovered
,
he
knew
he
would
be
lost
,
for
the
roof
afforded
no
chance
of
escape
;
he
therefore
resolved
to
descend
,
not
through
the
same
chimney
by
which
he
had
come
up
,
but
by
a
similar
<NUMBER>
conducting
to
another
room
.
The
brigadier
,
calm
and
dignified
as
the
law
he
represented
,
passed
through
the
crowd
,
without
answering
the
<NUMBER>
questions
addressed
to
him
,
and
re-entered
the
hotel
.
The
honorable
<UNK>
had
scarcely
expressed
himself
thus
,
in
that
intonation
which
is
peculiar
to
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
,
when
a
loud
scream
,
accompanied
by
the
violent
ringing
of
a
bell
,
resounded
through
the
court
of
the
hotel
.
``
What
number
was
it
that
rang
?
''
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
brigadier
,
stopping
the
servant
,
``
the
person
who
is
ringing

to
want

``
I

The
brigadier
,
followed
by
the
commissary
,
disappeared
by
the
inside
staircase
,
accompanied
by
the
noise
which
his
assertions
respecting
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
excited
in
the
crowd
.
<NUMBER>
ladies
,
sleeping
in
<NUMBER>
bed
,
were
awakened
by
the
noise

and
fixing
their

upon
the

whence
the

proceeded

they
saw
a

Save

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
taking
the
bell
from
her
companion
's
hand
,
and
ringing
it
yet
more
violently
.
``
It
is
too
late

coming

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

A
violent
blow
from
the
butt
end
of
the
musket
burst
open
the
lock
,
<NUMBER>
more
forced
out
the
bolts
,
and
the
broken
door
fell
in
.
``
Or

he
cried
,
throwing
down
his
knife
;
``
why
should
I
do
so

``
Come

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
held
out

An

after
they
stepped
into

both
dressed
in
feminine

she
exclaimed
,
throwing
herself
into
the
arms
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
her
eyes
sparkling
with
the

kind
of
rage
which
made

wish
that

had
but

neck
,
that
he
might

it
at
a

We
will
leave
the
banker
contemplating
the
enormous

of
his
debt
before
the
phantom

bankruptcy

follow
the
baroness
,
who
after
being
momentarily
crushed
under
the
weight
of
the
blow
which
had
struck
her
,
had
gone
to
seek
her
usual

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

She
ran
therefore
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
after
having
like
the
rest
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
witnessed
the
contract
scene
and
the
scandal
attending
it
,
had
retired
in
haste
to
his

where
he
was
chatting
with
some

upon

events
which
served
as
a

known

Meanwhile
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
veiled
and
uneasy
,
awaited
the
return
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
little
green
room

seated
between
<NUMBER>
baskets

,
which

had

sent

and
which

it

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
himself
arranged
and
watered
with
so
much
care
that
his

was
half
excused
in

She
was
fearful

``

said
the

she
said
to

And
then
her

cleaving
through

rested
on
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

shadow
of
guilt
called
contempt
of
court
.
For
the
last
month
this
wretched
house
had
presented
the
gloomy
appearance
of
a
<UNK>
<UNK>
with
the
plague
.
He
saw
a
lady
,
a
fashionable
,
elegantly
dressed
lady
,
and
yet
the
door
remained
almost
closed
.
``
Who
am
I
?
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
``
The
baroness

''
``
You
can
imagine
so
,

not

brought

The
concierge
closed
the
door
,
leaving
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
street
.
``
You
will
excuse
this
poor

he
said
,
as
he
preceded
the
baroness
,
``
but
his
orders
are
precise

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
raising
his
head
,
bowed
down
by
grief
,
looked
up
at
her
with
so
sad
a
smile
that
her
complaints
died
upon

lips

she
said
.
``

here

``
A

``
Everything

be

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

she
asked
in
a
tone
full
of
mournful
dignity
.
``
Speak

But
this

let

change
the

M.

nothing
more
nor
less

``
Well

At

``
For

``
I

No

she
exclaimed
in

<UNK>
manner

Alas

``
But
this
is
trampling
on
the

''
``
Oh

''
exclaimed
the
baroness
,
``
you

without

I

``
No

said

``
I
tell

it

this

the

-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
valet
de
chambre
,
entering
the
room
,
``
a
dragoon
has
brought
this
despatch
from

he
exclaimed
;
``
he
was
taken
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
all
is
over

''
Then
,
turning
to
his
desk
,
he
said
,
striking
the
letter
with
the
back
of
his
right
hand
,
``
Come

I
had
a

and
here
it
is
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
weak
that
this
recital
scarcely
produced
the
same
effect
it
would
have
done
had
she
been
in
her
usual
state
of
health
.
A
nurse
of
the
doctor
's
choice
succeeded
them
,
and
never
left
till
about
<NUMBER>
or
eleven
o'clock
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
asleep
.
Now
<NUMBER>
days
had
elapsed
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
lived
.
<NUMBER>
o'clock
had
struck
.
The
<UNK>
threw
out
<UNK>
rays
,
each
<UNK>
itself
into
some
strange
form
to
her
disordered
imagination
,
when
suddenly
by
its
flickering
light
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
she
saw
the
door
of
her
library
,
which
was
in
the
recess
by
the
chimney-piece
,
open
slowly
,
though
she
in
vain
listened
for
the
sound
of
the
hinges
on
which
it
turned
.
The
figure
advanced
towards
the
bed
and
appeared
to
listen
with
profound
attention
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
reached
her
hand
towards
the
glass
,
but
as
soon
as
her
trembling
arm
left
the
bed
the
apparition
advanced
more
quickly
towards
her
,
and
approached
the
young
girl
so
closely
that
she
fancied
she
heard
his
breath
,
and
felt
the
pressure
of
his
hand
.
This
did
not
seem
sufficient
;
the
man
,
or
rather
the
ghost
-
for
he
trod
so
softly
that
no
sound
was
heard
-
then
poured
out
about
a
spoonful
into
the
glass
,
and
drank
it
.
It
was
the
first
time
<NUMBER>
of
these
visions
had
ever
addressed
her
in
a
living
voice
,
and
she
was
about
to
utter
an
exclamation
.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
no
doubt
now
remained
in
the
young
girl
's
mind
as
to
the
reality
of
the
scene
;
her
eyes
started
with
terror
,
her
hands
trembled
,
and
she
rapidly
drew
the
bedclothes
closer
to
her
.
The
count
's
marvellous
sagacity
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
the
young
girl
's
mind
.
she
exclaimed
,
and
so
sweet
did
the
sound
appear
to
her
,
that
she
repeated
it
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
``
You
have
promised
him
that
I
shall
live
?
''
``
Yes
;
the
best
you
could
have
at
the
present
time
,
believe
me
.
''
The
count
extended
his
hand
towards
the
library
.
``
<UNK>
-
death
!
''
``
Drink
this
,
and
then
take
nothing
more
to-night
.
''
Thank
you
,
sir
,
thank
you
!
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the
height
of
her
terror
,
``
you
say
you
endured
tortures
when
you
saw
the
deadly
poison
poured
into
my
glass
;
but
if
you
saw
this
,
you
must
also
have
seen
the
person
who
poured
it
?
''
repeated
the
young
girl
.
What
?
Have
you
not
seen

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,

``
Oh

yes

yes

But
even
this
would
have
availed
little
against
a
more
deadly
medium
of
death
employed
<NUMBER>
days
ago
,
which
is
generally
but
too
fatal
.
''
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
have
frequently
seen
shadows
pass
close
to
me
,
approach
,
and
disappear
;
but
I
took
them
for
visions
raised
by
my
feverish
imagination
,
and
indeed
when
you
entered
I
thought
I
was
under
the
influence
of
delirium
.
''
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
Midnight
struck
slowly
and
sadly
;
every
hour
seemed
to
strike
with
leaden
weight
upon
the
heart
of
the
poor
girl
.
``
Good-by
,
for
the
present
,
''
replied
the
count
,
walking
upon
tiptoe
towards
the
library
door
,
and
smiling
with
an
expression
so
sad
and
paternal
that
the
young
girl
's
heart
was
filled
with
gratitude
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
attention
was
engrossed
by
the
clock
in
her
room
,
which
marked
the
seconds
.
What
had
she
done
to
excite
the
malice
of
an
enemy
?
-
What
if
the
count
should
have
no
time
to
run
to
her
rescue
!
<NUMBER>
minutes
,
<NUMBER>
tedious
minutes
,
passed
thus
,
then
<NUMBER>
more
,
and
at
last
the
clock
struck
the
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
summoned
every
effort
,
and
breathed
with
that
regular
respiration
which
announces
tranquil
sleep
.
Then
everything
was
still
,
excepting
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
the
almost
noiseless
sound
of
some
liquid
being
poured
into
the
glass
she
had
just
emptied
.
On
recognizing
her
step-mother
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
repress
a
shudder
,
which
caused
a
vibration
in
the
bed
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
however
,
reassured
by
the
silence
,
which
was
alone
disturbed
by
the
regular
breathing
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
again
extended
her
hand
,
and
half
hidden
by
the
curtains
succeeded
in
emptying
the
contents
of
the
phial
into
the
glass
.
The
grating
against
the
<UNK>
aroused
the
young
girl
from
the
stupor
in
which
she
was
plunged
,
and
which
almost
amounted
to
insensibility
.
``
Oh
,
''
murmured
the
young
girl
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
groaned
.
-
can
I
not
escape
?
''
``
Yes

but
not
against

If

``

bathed

<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
extremity
of
her
terror
joined
her
hands
,
-
for
she
felt
that
the
moment
had
arrived
to
ask
for
courage

and
began
to
pray
,
and
while
uttering
little
more
than
incoherent

she
forgot

long
hair
,
and
that

her

the

She
evidently
interrogated
him
by
her
look

try

a

The

continued
to
burn
on
the
chimney-piece
,
<UNK>
the
last
drops
of
oil
which
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water

It
was
then
that
the
door
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
opened
,
and
a
head
we
have
before
noticed
appeared
in
the
glass
opposite
;
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
came
to
witness
the
effects

the
drink
she
had
prepared
.
If
any
<NUMBER>
could
have
looked
into
the
room
just
then
he
would
have
noticed
the
hesitation
with
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
approached
the
bed
and
looked
fixedly
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
gazed
upon
the
face
so
expressive
even
in
its
stillness
;
then
she
ventured
to
raise
the
coverlet
and
press
her
hand
upon
the
young
girl
's
heart
.
The
nails
,
too
,
were
turning
blue
.
There
was
no
more
to
do
in
the
room
,
so
the
poisoner
retired
stealthily
,
as
though
fearing
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
own
footsteps
;
but
as
she
withdrew
she
still
held
aside
the
curtain
,
absorbed
in
the
irresistible
attraction
always
exerted
by
the
picture
of
death
,
so
long
as
it
is
merely
mysterious
and
does
not
excite
disgust
.
The
darkness
lasted
<NUMBER>
hours
longer
;
then
by
degrees
a
cold
light
crept
through
the
Venetian
blinds
,
until
at
length
it
revealed
the
objects
in
the
room
.
Then
she
went
to
the
fireplace
and
lit
the
fire
,
and
although
she
had
just
left
her
bed
,
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
offered
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
sleep
,
so
she
threw
herself
into
an
arm-chair
to
snatch
a
little
more
rest
.
She
screamed
aloud
;
then
running
to
the
door
exclaimed
,
-
``
Help
,
help
!

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rushing
from
his
room

``
Call

<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
into
the
room

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
voice
terrible
in
its
solemn
calm
.
On
a
sudden
she
stepped
,
or
rather
bounded
,
with
outstretched
arms
,
towards
the
table
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
the
same
color
as
the
draught
she
had
poured
into
the
glass
,
and
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
drank
;
it
was
indeed
the
poison
,
which
could
not
deceive
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
he
now
examined
so
closely
;
it
was
doubtless
a
miracle
from
heaven
,
that
,
notwithstanding
her
precautions
,
there
should
be
some
trace
,
some
proof
remaining
to
reveal
the
crime

``
Ah

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

the

<UNK>
the

reaching

on

At

had
presented

at

door
leading

room

Every
night
the
count
had
given
him
news
,
which
was
the
next
morning
confirmed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
old
man
sitting
in
his
arm-chair
in
his
usual
place
,
but
his
eyes
expressed
alarm
,
which
was
confirmed
by
the
pallor
which
overspread
his
features
.
``
You
are
thoughtful
,
sir
,
''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
you
want
something
;
shall
I
call
<NUMBER>
of
the
servants
?
''
``
Oh
,
''
exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
why
do
they
not
come
?
You
alarm
me
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
to
speak
,
but
he
could
<UNK>
nothing
;
he
staggered
,
and
supported
himself
against
the
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
up
the
little
staircase
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
eyes
seemed
to
say
,
-
``
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
!
''
He
saw
as
though
in
a
mist
,
a
black
figure
kneeling
and
buried
in
a
confused
mass
of
white
drapery
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
,
half
ashamed
of
being
surprised
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
grief
.
Go
,
sir
,
go
!
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
to
lead
<PROPER_NOUN>
out
.
When
he
reached
the
landing
he
placed
the
arm-chair
on
the
floor
and
rapidly
rolled
it
into
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
.
Each
time
he
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
his
father
,
something
terrible
had
happened
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
back
and
looked
with
astonishment
on
the
young
man
,
who
,
almost
a
stranger
to
him
,
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
his
father
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seizing
the
moist
hand
of
the
paralytic
,
``
they
ask
me
who
I
am
,
and
what
right
I
have
to
be
here

<NUMBER>
could
have
thought
that
he
was
undergoing
the
agonies
preceding
death
.
Tell
them
-
oh
,
tell
them
,
that
corpse
belongs
to
me
!
''
For
some
time
nothing
was
heard
in
that
chamber
but
sobs
,
exclamations
,
and
prayers
.
Take
a
last
farewell
,
sir
,
of
her
sad
remains
;
take
the
hand
you
expected
to
possess
once
more
within
your

and
then
separate
yourself
from
her
forever

``
What

said

reading
all
that
passed
through

The
young
man
's
implacable
eyes
interrogated
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
on
his
side
,
glanced
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

striving

commanded

Ask

uttered

the

Certainly

after
witnessing
the
culpable
indolence
manifested
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
towards
his

I
ought

``

he
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
,
``

``

indicated
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
an

the
more

from
all

being

Then
,
having
riveted

on

he

towards

delighted

The

drew
back

Do

said

suffered
an
exclamation

<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
:

an

was

obliged

to
superintend
all

upon
a

in
a

At

an

M.

returned
with
his

they
found
the

closed

not
a

remaining
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
was
obliged

open

The
district
doctor
approached
with
the
indifference

a

accustomed
to
spend
half
his
time
amongst
the
dead
;
he
then
lifted
the
sheet

was
placed
over

just
<UNK>
the

approached

dipping
the

with

had
touched
the

he
uncovered
the

looked

``
The

again
bade

D'Avrigny
accosted

took

without

they
reached

The

the

returned

The

<NUMBER>

she
passed

ran
up-stairs
without

she
tapped

how

continued
:

These

a

He
bestowed

front
of
a

considerably
changed

The

``

The
judges
took
their
places
in
the
midst
of
the
most
profound
silence
;
the
<UNK>
took
their
seats
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
object

unusual
attention

and
we
had
almost
said
of
general
admiration
,
sat
in
the
arm-chair
and
cast
a
tranquil
glance
around
him
.
The
door
soon
opened
and
the
accused
appeared
.
Scarcely
had
he
entered
the
hall
when
he
glanced
at
the
whole
body
of
magistrates
and
assistants
;
his
eye
rested
longer
on
the
president

and
still
more
so
on
the
king

attorney

During
the
reading
of
this

,
the

continually
drawn

<PROPER_NOUN>

who

<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
no

arose
.
The
astonished
president
looked
at
the
<UNK>
,
who
in
turn
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
I
will
answer

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
busy
taking
down
some
notes
,
raised
his
head
at
the
mention
of
this
date
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
second
time
raised
his
head
,
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
if
he
had
been
gazing
at
the
head
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
became
livid
.
A
murmur
,
or
rather
storm
,
of
indignation
burst
from
all
parts
of
the
assembly
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
his
most
<UNK>
smile
.
``
The
brutal
affectation
with
which
you

both
in

for

``
This

indeed

the
reason

I
begged

alter

``
Well
,
''
said
the
president
;
``
your
name
?
''
Not
a
whisper
,
not
a
breath
,
was
heard
in
that
vast
assembly
;
every
<NUMBER>
waited
anxiously
.
``
Yes
;
and
if
you
wish
to
know
his

I
will
tell
it

he

''
Several
persons
hurried
up
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
sat
half
bowed
over
in
his
chair
,
offering
him
consolation

encouragement

and
protestations
of
zeal
and
sympathy
.
They
ask
my
age
;
I
tell
it
.
Now
I
repeat
,
my
father
is
named

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
I
am
ready
to
prove
it
.
''
``
But
,
''
said
the
irritated
president
,
``
you
called
yourself
<PROPER_NOUN>

declared
yourself
an
orphan

and
claimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
your

I
will
give
them
.
asked
the
president
.
The
man
carried
me
to
the
<UNK>
asylum
,
where
I
was
registered
under
the
number
<NUMBER>
.
``
Proceed
,
''
said
the
president
.
After
that
I
ceased
to
<UNK>
,
but
I
cursed
my
father
.
asked
the
president
.
She
was
carried
out
of
the
hall
,
the
thick
veil
which
concealed
her
face
dropped
off
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
recognized
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
laughing
;
``
do
you
want
proofs
?
''
The
whole
assembly
uttered
a
long
murmur
of
astonishment
.
cried
the
president
,
``
what
do
you
mean
?
''
A
dull
,
gloomy
silence
,
like
that
which
precedes
some
awful
<UNK>
of
nature
,
pervaded
the
assembly
,
who
shuddered
in
dismay
.
Come
,
recover
.
''
And
as
he
spoke
these
words
with
a
hoarse
,
choking
voice
,
he
staggered
towards
the
door
,
which
was
mechanically
opened
by
a
door-keeper
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
would
rather
end
my
career
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
a
pistol-shot
seems
quite
delightful
compared
with
this
catastrophe
.
''
``
The
sitting
is
<UNK>
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
president
;
``
fresh
inquiries
will
be
made
,
and
the
case
will
be
tried
next
<UNK>
by
another
magistrate
.
''
``
There
will
be
<UNK>
circumstances
,
''
he
replied
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
passed
through
the
mass
of
spectators
and
officers
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
withdrew
.
It
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
state
of
stupor
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
weight
of
his
fallen
fortunes
seemed
suddenly
to
crush
him
;
he
could
not
foresee
the
consequences
;
he
could
not
contemplate
the
future
with
the
indifference
of
the
hardened
criminal
who
merely
faces
a
<UNK>
already
familiar
.
The
carriage
rolled
rapidly
onward
.
``
Oh
!
''
He
had
just
acted
the
inexorable
judge
with
her
,
he
had
condemned
her
to
death
,
and
she
,
crushed
by
remorse
,
struck
with
terror
,
covered
with
the
shame
inspired
by
the
eloquence
of
his
irreproachable
virtue
,
-
she
,
a
poor
,
weak
woman
,
without
help
or
the
power
of
defending
herself
against
his
absolute
and
supreme
will
,
-
she
might
at
that
very
moment
,
perhaps
,
be
preparing
to
die
!
I
carried
the
<UNK>
of
crime
with
me
,
and
she
has
caught
it
as
she
would
the
<UNK>
fever
,
the
<UNK>
,
the
plague
!
I
told
her
of
the
scaffold
;
oh
,
heavens
,
I
forgot
that
it
awaits
me
also
!
She
must
live
that
my
infamy
may
diminish
hers
.
''
The
horses
,
impelled
by
fear
,
flew
towards
the
house
.
She
will
repent
,
and
no
one
will
know
that
she
has
been
guilty
.
I
shall
have
performed
a
good
action
,
and
my
heart
will
be
lighter
.
''
Neither
of
them
spoke
to
him
;
they
merely
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass
by
,
as
usual
,
nothing
more
.
``
No
one
must
disturb
us
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
must
speak
freely
to
her
,
accuse
myself
,
and
say
''
-
he
approached
the
door
,
touched
the
crystal
handle
,
which
yielded
to
his
hand
.
``
Not
here
,
''
he
said
;
``
doubtless
she
is
in
her
bedroom
.
''
He
fancied
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
piece
of
furniture
being
removed
.
answered
the
voice
of
her
he
sought
.
``
Open
;
it
is
I.
''
But
notwithstanding
this
request
,
notwithstanding
the
tone
of
anguish
in
which
it
was
uttered
,
the
door
remained
closed
.
he
said
,
``
what
is
the
matter
?
``
What
more
do
you
want
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
maddened
with
horror
,
stepped
back
to
the
<UNK>
of
the
door
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
corpse
:
``
My
son
!
''
The
name
was
pronounced
in
such
a
tone
of
anguish
that
the
servants
ran
up
.
``
No
,
sir
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
sent
for
him
half
an
hour
ago
;
he
went
into
her
room
,
and
has
not
been
down-stairs
since
.
''
To
enter
the
room
he
must
again
see
the
body
of
his
unfortunate
wife
.
he
stammered
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
The
corpse
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
stretched
across
the
doorway
leading
to
the
room
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
must
be
;
those
glaring
eyes
seemed
to
watch
over
the
threshold
,
and
the
lips
bore
the
stamp
of
a
terrible
and
mysterious
irony
.
He
had
only
to
step
over
the
corpse
,
enter
the
boudoir
,
take
the
child
in
his
arms
,
and
flee
far
,
far
away
.
He
took
the
child
in
his
arms
,
embraced
him
,
shook
him
,
called
him
,
but
the
child
made
no
response
.
He
picked
up
the
paper
,
and
,
recognizing
his
wife
's
writing
,
ran
his
eyes
rapidly
over
its
contents
;
it
ran
as
follows
:
-
``
You
know
that
I
was
a
good
mother
,
since
it
was
for
my
son
's
sake
I
became

The
presence
of
the
<NUMBER>
victims
alarmed
him
;
he
could
not
bear
solitude
shared
only
by
<NUMBER>
corpses
.
The
old
man
appeared
to
be
listening
attentively
and
as
affectionately
as
his
<UNK>
would
allow
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
looked
cold
and
calm
,
as
usual

he
exclaimed
;
``

never

``
I

to
forgive

The
abbe
threw
off
his
<UNK>
,
shook
his
head
,
and
his
hair
,
no
longer
confined
,
fell
in
black
masses
around
his
manly
face
.
``

exclaimed
the
king

attorney
;
``
you
are

-
``

said

pointing
to
the

Oh

with
a
dull

heavy
heart
,
all
the
noble
features
of
that
face

usually
so
calm
and
serene

were
<UNK>
by
grief

The
servant

instead
of
answering
,
pointed
to
the
garden
.
``
It
is
not
here

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
back
in
horror

On
entering
his

he
met
<PROPER_NOUN>

who
wandered
about
like
a

awaiting
the
heavenly
mandate
for
return

``
No

replied

<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his

conversed

about

said
the
count

without

the

produced

And
pressing
his
lips
on
the
hand
of

,
who
rushed
into

he
extended
his

tearing

from

he
made

followed

was
on

the

struck

It

The

the

called
the

immediately
rowed
up
to

with
the

As
they
reached
the

the

instinctively
shrunk
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
boat

the
owner
was
obliged

call

After
finishing

I
had
a

who
earned

into
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
high
water
from
the
bridge
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

He
reached
it
before
the
carriage
arrived
.
inquired
the
stranger
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
The
clerk
continued
to
write
for
the
next
<NUMBER>
minutes
;
the
man
preserved
profound
silence
,
and
remained
perfectly
motionless
.
``
There
is
no

merit
due
to
me
,
for
we
were
informed
of

``
Very

only
do
not

false

``
No

he
really
had

we
found
them

``
Indeed

``
Well

''
``
Yes

you

``
Then
why
do
you
apply

''
``
Hush

here

''
According
to
the
arrangements
,
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
.
The
cicerone
<UNK>
the
door
,
and
sprang
up
by
the
side
of
the
coachman
.
``
I
did
not
come
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
to

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
aloud
;
then
he
added
softly
,
with
an
avaricious
smile
,
``
I
came
to
touch
!
''
said
the
cicerone
to
the
coachman
,
and
the
carriage
drove
rapidly
on
.
The
next
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
awoke
late
,
though
he
went
to
bed
so
early
;
he
had
not
slept
well
for
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
nights
,
even
if

All
these

had
collected
a

round
the
door
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
;
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the

were
also
not
wanting
.
asked
the
postilion
in
Italian
.
He
had
scarcely
advanced
<NUMBER>
leagues
out
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
daylight
began
to
disappear
.
The
carriage
again
moved
on
.
What
subject
of
meditation
could
present
itself
to
the
banker
,
so
fortunately
become
bankrupt
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
continued
to
sleep
,
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
be
sure
to
awake
at
the
<UNK>
.
He
intended
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
fresh
inquiries
of
the
new
conductor
;
but
the
horses
were
unharnessed
,
and
others
put
in
their
places
,
without
any
<NUMBER>
claiming
money
from
the
traveller
.
he
said
to
the
postilion
,
``
eh
,
<UNK>
<UNK>
?
''
``
Come
,
my
friend
,
''
he
said
,
thrusting
his
hand
through
the
opening
,
``
where
are
we
going
?
''
He
was
making
rapid
progress
in
Italian
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
observed
a
man
in
a
cloak
galloping
at
the
right
hand
of
the
carriage
.
He
resolved
to
end
his
anxiety
.
Danglars
turned
to
the
left
;
another
man
on
horseback
was
galloping
on
that
side
.
He
then
saw
the
great
<UNK>
,
those
stone
phantoms
which
he
had
before
remarked
,
only
then
they
were
on
the
right
hand
,
now
they
were
on
the
left
.
The
carriage
continued
to
roll
on
with
frightful
speed
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
we
are
not
returning
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
then
it
is
not
justice
which
is
pursuing
me
!
Just
then
the
carriage
rolled
on
something
harder
than
gravel
road
.
On
a
word
from
the
man
who
rode
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
,
it
stopped
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
instantly
descended
;
although
he
did
not
yet
speak
Italian
,
he
understood
it
very
well
.
Danglars
followed
his
guide
without
opposition
,
and
had
no
occasion
to
turn
around
to
see
whether
the
<NUMBER>
others
were
following
him
.
``
<UNK>
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
before
a
pit
<UNK>
by
thick
hedges
;
the
pit
,
half
open
,
afforded
a
passage
to
the
young
man
,
who
disappeared
like
the
evil
spirits
in
the
fairy
tales
.
Notwithstanding
his
large
stomach
,
certainly
not
intended
to
penetrate
the
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
slid
down
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
closing
his
eyes
fell
upon
his
feet
.
<NUMBER>
other
men
descended
after
<PROPER_NOUN>
forming
the
<UNK>
,
and
pushing
<PROPER_NOUN>
whenever
he
happened
to
stop
,
they
came
by
a
gentle
declivity
to
the
<UNK>
of
<NUMBER>
corridors
.
he
cried
.
``
Fine
spoil
,
captain
,
fine
spoil
!
''
``
Himself
,
captain

''
``
The

tired

''
said
the
captain
,
``

''
He
no
longer
possessed
strength
,
will
,
power
,
or
feeling
;
he
followed
where
they
led
him
.
A
bed
of
dried
grass
covered
with
<UNK>
was
placed
in
<NUMBER>
corner
.
said
the
guide
,
and
pushing
<PROPER_NOUN>
into
the
cell
,
he
closed
the
door
upon
him
.
These
recollections
were
dwelt
upon
with
some
pleasure
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
restored
him
to
some
degree
of
tranquillity
.
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
crowns
amounted
to
<NUMBER>
livres
;
he
would
then
have
about
<NUMBER>
francs
left
.
He
awoke
.
His
first
idea
was
to
breathe
,
that
he
might
know
whether
he
was
wounded
.
They
were
untouched
;
the
<NUMBER>
louis
he
had
reserved
for
his
journey
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
in
his
trousers
pocket
,
and
in
that
of
his
great-coat
he
found
the
little
<UNK>
containing
his
letter
of
credit
for
<NUMBER>
francs
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
here
is
my
watch
!
Should
he
demand
an
explanation
from
the
bandits
,
or
should
he
wait
patiently
for
them
to
propose
it
?
He
had
noticed
that
a
few
rays
,
not
of
daylight
,
but
from
a
lamp
,
penetrated
through
the
<UNK>
planks
of
the
door
;
he
approached
just
as
the
brigand
was
<UNK>
himself
with
a
mouthful
of
brandy
,
which
,
owing
to
the
<UNK>
bottle
containing
it
,
sent
forth
an
odor
which
was
extremely
unpleasant
to
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
He
was
an
<UNK>
,
gigantic
bandit
,
with
large
eyes
,
thick
lips
,
and
a
flat
nose
;
his
red
hair
fell
in
dishevelled
masses
like
<UNK>
around
his
shoulders
.
and
he
withdrew
to
seat
himself
upon
his
goat-skin
,
which
reminded
him
of
the
smell
of
the
brandy
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
that
he
was
heard
,
so
he
redoubled
his
blows
.
But
whether
he
did
not
understand
him
,
or
whether
he
had
received
no
orders
respecting
the
nourishment
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
giant
,
without
answering
,
went
on
with
his
dinner
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
was
preparing
to
mount
guard
as
comfortably
as
possible
by
seating
himself
opposite
to
the
door
,
and
placing
between
his
legs
an
<UNK>
pan
,
containing
<UNK>
<UNK>
with
bacon
.
``
Come
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
let
me
try
if
he
will
be
more
<UNK>
than
the
other
;
''
and
he
tapped
gently
at
the
door
.
``
Does
your

happen
to
be

``
What
would
your

``
Well

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
around
,
shouted
,
``
A
fowl
for
his
excellency

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
for
a
knife
and
fork
.
They
might
not
be
satisfied
,
and
''
-
``
Ah
,
ha
,
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
this
is
not
so
much
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
except
that
I
shall
probably
be

<PROPER_NOUN>
picked
up
the
louis
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
prepared
to
<UNK>
the
fowl
.
``
A

Though
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
see

the
noise
of
his
teeth
allowed
no
doubt
as
to
his
occupation

<PROPER_NOUN>
pretended
not
to
hear
him
,
and
without
even
turning
his
head
continued
to
eat
slowly
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

your

is
you

tell
us
what

``

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Here

he
said
,
``
here
is
a

''
The
next
day
Danglars
was
again
hungry
;
certainly
the
air
of
that
dungeon
was
very
<UNK>
of
appetite
.
The
sentinel
opened
the
door
;
it
was
a
new
face
.
``
Something
to
drink
.
''
``
Come
,
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
it

``
Well

have

``
Tell

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
tone
whose
bitterness
<PROPER_NOUN>

alone
has
been
capable
of
revealing
-
``
tell

``

Who

<PROPER_NOUN>
meditated
an
escape
;
but
the
walls
were
solid
rock
,
a
man
was
sitting
reading
at
the
only
outlet
to
the
cell
,
and
behind
that
man
shapes
armed
with
guns
continually
passed
.
At
the
end
of
<NUMBER>
days
,
after
having
made
a
splendid
dinner
,
he
reckoned
his
accounts
,
and
found
that

had
only
<NUMBER>
francs
left
.
Sometimes
he
was
delirious
,
and
fancied
he
saw
an
old
man
stretched
on
a
<UNK>
;
he
,
also
,
was
dying

hunger

did
not

``
Still

He
struck
his
forehead
on
the
ground
and
groaned
.
His
feeble
eyes
endeavored
to
distinguish
objects
,
and
behind
the
bandit
he
saw
a
man
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
half
lost
in

shadow
of
a
stone
column

``
Oh

yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
more
pale
from
terror

he
had
been

<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
uttered
a
cry
,
and
fell
prostrate
.
And
now
eat

drink
;
I
will
entertain
you
to-night

He
remained
there
all
night
,
not
knowing
where
he
was
.
The
heat
of
the
day
had
gradually
<UNK>
,
and
a
light
breeze
arose
,
seeming
like
the
respiration

nature
on
awakening
from
the
burning
<UNK>
of
the
south
.
It
advanced
swiftly
and
gracefully
,
leaving
behind
it
a
glittering
stretch
of
foam
.
``
Is
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

repeated
the
traveller
in
an
accent
of
indescribable
sadness

``

the

The

descended

instead

down
at
the
stern
of
the
boat

which
had
been
decorated
with

In

the

on

The

the

in

pressing

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived

<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
with

``

My

``
Let

he

looking
at
the

I

all

``
And

It

away

``
No

said
the

``
do

Now

he

``

brightened
at

He
placed
the

then
opening
it
took
out
a
little
golden
box
,
the
top
of
which
flew
open
when
touched
by

It

Then
they
were
both
silent

An
<UNK>
sadness
took
possession
of
the
young
man
,
his
hands
relaxed
their
hold
,
the
objects
in
the
room
gradually
lost
their
form

color

and
his

seemed
to
perceive
doors

At

the

He

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
around

An

during

breathless

watched
steadfastly
over

<PROPER_NOUN>
soon
perceived
a

standing
among
the
rocks
,
apparently
awaiting
a
sign
from
them
to

and
pointed
him
out
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
I

opened

Where

The
eyes

both
were
fixed
upon

the
sailor
,

on
the
blue
line
separating
the

In

We

struck
us

occurred
to
us
that

they

It
may
be
easily
imagined
how
great
was
our
joy
when
,
in

we
found
at

Many

,
seeing
the
women
flying
toward
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
leaving
their
children
crying
at
the
open
doors
,
hastened
to
<UNK>
the
cuirass
,
and
supporting
their
somewhat
uncertain
courage
with
a
musket
or
a
partisan
,
directed
their
steps
toward
the
hostelry
of
the
Jolly
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
before
which
was
gathered
,
increasing
every
minute
,
a
compact
group
,
vociferous
and
full
of
curiosity
.
The
citizens
always
took
up
arms
readily
against
thieves
,
wolves
or
scoundrels
,
often
against
nobles
or
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
sometimes
against

but
never
against
cardinal
or

Imagine
to
yourself
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<NUMBER>
;
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
his
<UNK>
,
without
his
coat
of
mail
,
without
his
<UNK>
;
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
clothed
in
a
wooden
doublet
,
the
blue
color
of
which
had
faded
into
a
<UNK>
shade
between
<UNK>
of
wine
and
a
heavenly
azure
;
face
long
and
brown
;
high
cheek
bones
,
a
sign
of
sagacity
;
the
<UNK>
muscles
enormously
developed
,
an
infallible
sign
by
which
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
may
always
be
detected
,
even
without
his
cap
-
and
our
young
man
wore
a
cap
set
off
with
a
sort
of
feather
;
the
eye
open
and
intelligent
;
the
nose
hooked
,
but
finely
<UNK>
.
Unfortunately
,
the
qualities
of
this
horse
were
so
well
concealed
under
his
<UNK>
hide
and
his
unaccountable
gait
,
that
at
a
time
when
everybody
was
a
connoisseur
in
<UNK>
,
the
appearance
of
the
<UNK>
pony
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
which
place
he
had
entered
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
by
the
gate
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
produced
an
<UNK>
feeling
,
which
extended
to
his
rider
.
``
My
son

''
said
the
old
<PROPER_NOUN>
gentleman
,
in
that
pure
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
could
never
rid
himself
,
``
this
horse
was
born
in
the
house
of
your
father
about
<NUMBER>
years
ago
,
and
has
remained
in

ever
since
,
which
ought
to
make
you
love
it
.
<UNK>
nothing
from
anyone
except
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
king
.
You
ought
to
be
brave
for
<NUMBER>
reasons
:
the
first
is
that
you
are
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
second
is
that
you
are
my
son
.
<UNK>
the
more
for
duels
being
forbidden
,
since
consequently
there
is
twice
as
much
courage
in
fighting
.
I
have
but
<NUMBER>
word
to
add
,
and
that
is
to
propose
an
example
to
you
-
not
mine
,
for
I
myself
have
never
appeared
at
court
,
and
have
only
taken
part
in
religious
wars
as
a
volunteer
;
I
speak
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
formerly
my
neighbor

and
who
had
the
honor
to
be
,
as
a
child
,
the
<UNK>
of
our
king
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
preserve
!
So
that
in
spite
of
edicts
,
<UNK>
,
and
decrees
,
there
he
is
,
captain
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
that
is
to
say
,
chief
of
a
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
the
king
holds
in
great
esteem
and
whom
the
cardinal
<UNK>
-
he
who
<UNK>
nothing
,
as
it
is
said
.
Upon
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
elder
girded
his
own
sword
round
his
son
,
kissed
him
tenderly
on
both
cheeks
,
and
gave
him
his
benediction
.
The
same
day
the
young
man
set
forward
on
his
journey
,
furnished
with
the
<NUMBER>
paternal
gifts
,
which
consisted
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
<NUMBER>
crowns
,
the
horse
,
and
the
letter
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
the
counsels
being
thrown
into
the
bargain
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
remained
majestic
and
intact
in
his
susceptibility
,
till
he
came
to
this
unlucky
city
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
gentleman
appeared
to
be
<UNK>
all
his
qualities
to
his
auditors
;
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
auditors
seeming
to
have
great
deference
for
the
narrator
,
they
every
moment
burst
into
fits
of
laughter
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
doublet
and
hose
of
a
violet
color
,
with
<UNK>
of
the
same
color
,
without
any
other
ornaments
than
the
customary
<UNK>
,
through
which
the
shirt
appeared
.
This
time
there
could
be
no
doubt
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
really
insulted
.
The
gentleman
raised
his
eyes
slowly
from
the
<UNK>
to
his
cavalier
,
as
if
he
required
some
time
to
ascertain
whether
it
could
be
to
him
that
such
strange
reproaches
were
addressed
;
then
,
when
he
could
not
possibly
entertain
any
doubt
of
the
matter
,
his
eyebrows
slightly
bent
,
and
with
an
accent
of
irony
and
insolence
impossible
to
be
described
,
he
replied
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
was
not
speaking
to
you
,
sir
.
''
His
quiet
manner
and
the
ironical
expression
of
his
countenance
redoubled
the
mirth
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
,
and
who
still
remained
at
the
window
.
``
There
are
people
who
laugh
at
the
horse
that
would
not
dare
to
laugh
at
the
master
,
''
cried
the
young
<UNK>
of
the
furious
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
and
turning
on
his
heel
,
was
about
to
re-enter
the
hostelry
by
the
front
gate
,
beneath
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
arriving
had
observed
a
saddled
horse
.
said
the
other
,
turning
on
his
heels
,
and
surveying
the
young
man
with
as
much
astonishment
as
contempt
.
He
had
scarcely
finished
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
such
a
furious
lunge
at
him
that
if
he
had
not
sprung
<UNK>
backward
,
it
is
probable
he
would
have
jested
for
the
last
time
.
<UNK>
him
on
his
orange
horse
,
and
let
him
begone
!
''
murmured
the
gentleman
.
But
the
stranger
knew
not
the
headstrong
personage
he
had
to
do
with
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
the
man
ever
to
cry
for
quarter
.
The
host
,
fearful
of
consequences
,
with
the
help
of
his
servants
carried
the
wounded
man
into
the
kitchen
,
where
some
trifling
attentions
were
bestowed
upon
him
.
``
Your
excellency
is
safe
and
sound
?
''

he
insisted

He
perceived
then

at

that

her

struck
him

``
Very

The

was
about

at

he
opened

But
when
the

came
to
pay

this

and
the

the

expense
the

had
incurred
,
as
he
had
preserved
a

-
while
on

the

But

our

the

``
I
tell
you

the

.
He
then
drew
<NUMBER>
crowns
majestically
from
his
purse

gave
them
to
the
host
,
who
accompanied
him
,
cap
in
hand

to
the
gate

and
remounted
his
yellow
horse
,
which
bore
him
without
any
further
accident
to
the
gate
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
his

sold
him
for
<NUMBER>

,
which
was
a

good
price
,
considering

As
soon
as
the

money
was
paid
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
possession
of
his
lodging
,
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
in

onto
his
doublet

hose

<UNK>

his
mother
had
taken

which
she
had
given
her

secretly

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

as
his

was
still
called

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
has
ended

really
commenced
life
as

now
did
;
that
is
to
say
,
without
a
sou
in
his
pocket
,
but
with
a
fund
of
audacity

shrewdness
,

intelligence
which
makes
the

often
derive
more
in
his
hope
from
the
paternal
inheritance
than
the
richest
<UNK>

gentleman
<UNK>
in
reality
from
his

This
was
a
great
matter
in
the
way

honor
,
but
very
little
in
the
way
of
wealth
;
so
that
when
the

companion

died
,
the
only
inheritance
he
was
able
to
leave
his

was
his

motto
.
Many
might
take
for
their
device
the
epithet
<UNK>
,
which
formed
the
second
part
of
his
motto
,
but
very
few
gentlemen
could
lay
claim

drawing

sometimes

In

let

say

was
this

accused
of
<UNK>
personal
advantage
from
the
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
absorbed
all

left

From
<NUMBER>

Musketeers

who
appeared

in
order
always
to
present
an
imposing
number
,
paraded
constantly
,
armed
to
the
teeth
and
ready
for
anything
.
In
this
apartment
a
continued
buzzing
prevailed
from
morning
till
night
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
his
office
contiguous
to
this
antechamber
,
received
visits
,
listened
to
complaints
,
gave
his
orders

and
like
the

at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

had
only

place
himself
at

to
review
both

In
order
to
make
<NUMBER>

waves

it
was
necessary

There

<NUMBER>

sport

He
who
at

occupied
the

kept
his
adversaries
marvelously
in
check
.
He
had
seen
in
his
province
-
that
land
in
which
heads
become
so
easily
heated
-
a
few
of
the
preliminaries
of
duels
;
but
the
daring
of
these
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
appeared
to
him
the
strongest
he
had
ever
heard
of
even
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
warm
and
fickle
imagination
,
which
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
rendered
formidable
to
young
<UNK>
,
and
even
sometimes
their
mistresses
,
had
never
dreamed
,
even
in
moments
of
delirium
,
of
half
the
amorous
wonders
or
a

of
the
feats
of
gallantry
which
were
here
set
forth
in
connection
with

the
best
known

with
details

Some
sang

about

<PROPER_NOUN>

his
mistress

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his

formed

to
annoy
the
pages
and
guards
of
the

duke
-
all
things
which
appeared
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
monstrous
impossibilities
.
What

my
good

say
,
who
so
strongly
pointed
out
to
me
the
respect
due
to

cardinal
,
if

recovered

leisure

This

At

moved
to

by

The

Immediately

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
opened

pointed
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>

who
bore
their

An

<PROPER_NOUN>
and

re-entered
,
the
surgeon
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
remaining
with

Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
made

all
retired

not

that
he
had
an

with

D'Artagnan

repeated

of

<PROPER_NOUN>
grasped

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
without

,
feeling
his
desire
to

the
<PROPER_NOUN>

uniform
<UNK>
increased
by
the
great
difficulties

preceded
the

of

<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
himself
up
with

plainly
said

Thanks
to

This

the

manifested
so
loudly
for
this

who

a

had
stolen

He
fixed

<PROPER_NOUN>

stopping
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
at

;
and
leaving
his

compatriot
in

the
window

where
they

talked

he
seated
himself
at

in

``
And

''
``
Ah

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

after

Between
the
<NUMBER>
talkers
there
was
just
enough
room
for
a

pass
.
Without

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
reasons

not
abandoning
this

for
instead

quitting
his

he
pulled

toward

so
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
rolled
himself
up
in
the
velvet
by
a
movement
of
<UNK>
explained
by

<UNK>
as
he
was

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
afford
to
have
a

wholly

but
had
at

half
.
``
Excuse

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
under

of
the

``

I

I

I

``
At

This

advantageous
to

in
<NUMBER>
sense
,
for
in
proportion
as
the
perspiration
broke
from
his

,
his
heart
began
to
cool
.
The
<UNK>
was
sad
.
The
only
thing
that
<UNK>
me
is
that
he
did
not
strike
me
dead
at

.
``
As

<PROPER_NOUN>

that

certainly
droll

I

He

have
pardoned

he

if
I
had
not

anything

him
about

in

it

true

rather
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
To
be
obliging

polite
does
not
necessarily
make

a
coward
.
Ah
!
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
contrary
,
quite
full

his

<UNK>
and
courtesy
,
approached
the

with
a
profound
bow

accompanied
by
a
most
gracious
smile

This
appeared
to
be
a
favorable
opportunity
to
repair
his
intrusion
.
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
So
saying
,
he
pulled
out
his
own
handkerchief
,
likewise
a
very
elegant
handkerchief
,
and
of
fine
cambric
-
though
cambric
was
dear
at
the
period

but
a
handkerchief
without
embroidery
and
without

,
only
ornamented
with
a
single
cipher
,
that
of
its
proprietor
.
``
You
make

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
and
while

I
refuse

Then
turning
toward
that
<NUMBER>
of
the
guards
who
had
declared
himself
the
friend
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
Besides

continued
he
,
``
I
have
reflected

my

can
possibly
be

so
that
decidedly
this

have
fallen
from

Now

here

``

interrupted
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

not
paved

Thank
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
am
not

``
Why
did
you
so
<UNK>
restore
me
the

``
Ah

you
take
it
with
that

do
you

<PROPER_NOUN>

``
I

monsieur

``
Yes

There
I
will
indicate

the

Besides
,
his
intention
was
formed
to
make
the
brave
<PROPER_NOUN>
all
suitable
apologies
,
but
without
meanness
or
weakness
,
fearing
that
might
result
from
this
duel
which
generally
results
from
an
affair
of
this
kind
,
when
a
young
and
vigorous
man
fights
with
an
adversary
who
is
wounded
and
weakened
-
if
conquered
,
he
doubles
the
triumph
of
his
antagonist
;
if
a
conqueror
,
he
is
accused
of
foul
play
and
want
of
courage
.
He
flattered
himself
he
should
be
able
to
frighten
Porthos
with
the
adventure
of
the
baldric
,
which
he
might
,
if
not
killed
upon
the
spot
,
relate
to
everybody
a
recital
which
,
well
managed
,
would
cover
Porthos
with
ridicule
.
When
<PROPER_NOUN>
arrived
in
sight
of
the
bare
spot
of
ground
which
extended
along
the
foot
of
the
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
waiting
about
<NUMBER>
minutes
,
and
<NUMBER>
o'clock
was
striking
.
``
I
have
no

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

<NUMBER>

``
Yes

I
know
only

But
I
will
take

it

in
such

``
You

<PROPER_NOUN>

bowing
again

``

``

with
timidity

Thus
spoke

acted
the
gallant
knights
of

every

ought
to
seek

In

had
come
up

waved
his

to
<PROPER_NOUN>

then
turning

stood
quite
astonished

pointing
to
D'Artagnan
with
his

saluting
him
with
the

gesture

not

with

answered

<UNK>
.
``
Oh

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
a

keep
secret
the

throwing
up
his

the

bold

were
at

gilded
by
a
bright
ray
of
the
sun

The
blood
had
mounted
to
the

at

he
would
have
drawn
his

willingly

Jussac
was
,
as
was

said

a
fine
blade
,
and
had
had
much
practice

nevertheless
it
required
all

departed

aimed

the

parried
it

Jussac
was
recovering

glided
like

passed

,
wounded

became

did

The

was

It

being

reached

this

That

were
informed

As
the

he

addressed

<UNK>
sharpened
by
his
victory
,
full
of
hopes

he
was
resolved
not

As

he

as

conquered

but
only
broke
away
toward

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

his

pressing

without

would
soon

the

arose
from

being
heard
in

<NUMBER>

rushed

from

fell

At

all
who
were

rushed
out
and
fell
upon
the

companions

who
on

cried
aloud

To

As
to
the

he
had
been
taken
in
at

,
as

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

accompanied
by

he

gone
stag
hunting

At

the

answered
that

resist
his

sport

and
set
out
after
dinner

``
He

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

On
entering
his
hotel
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
it
best
to
be
first
in
making
the
complaint

This
was
to
go
himself
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

This
time
,
however

his

was
<UNK>

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

In
addition
to
the

thrust
in
his

,
which
is
not
dangerous
,
he
has
received

the

says
bad

``
With

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
reflected
for
an

;
then
as
it
was
difficult
to
suggest
a
more
reasonable
proposal
,
he
agreed
to
it
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
unwilling
that
it
should
be
thought
that
he
had
influenced
the
wounded

requested

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
interrogate
him
himself

He
wished
<PROPER_NOUN>
a

,
took
leave

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
returned

immediately
sent

at
dinner

Toward

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
announced

audience
granted

past

claiming
the

by

back
stairs

he
placed
himself
with
the

young

in
the
antechamber
.
The
coming
instant
would
in
all
probability
decide
the
rest
of
his
life
.
At
the
first
glance
,
D'Artagnan
judged
that
the
mind
of
the
king
was
stormy

D'Artagnan
on
the

remained
concealed
behind

but
although

he
passed

without

indeed

as

The

waited

seeing

the

We

what

that
at

almost
all

nobody

the

had

to

to

begging

to
convey
his

his

Then
,
having
removed
a
plank
from
his

,
and
nothing
remaining
but
a
simple
ceiling
between
him
and
the

he
heard

If

to
himself

In

,
the
mousetrap
continued
in
operation

and
likewise
<PROPER_NOUN>

vigilance
.
Cries
were
soon
heard
,

moans
,
which

appeared
to
be
endeavoring
to
stifle
.

to

up
from

it

people
went
to
bed
early
in
the
quarter

There

ended
the

From
that

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
cautious
with
respect
to
handkerchiefs
with
arms
on

he
therefore
placed

<PROPER_NOUN>
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

And
something

lighted

``
Come

Both
resumed
their

and
he
tapped
thrice
-
<NUMBER>

close
together
and
pretty
hard
,
the

after
an
interval
,
and
lighter
.

All
the
events
we
have
described
had
taken
place
within
a
half
hour
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
assured
himself
,
by
having
it
twice
repeated
,
of
the
<UNK>
address
,
and
set
off
at
a
run
.
``
You
may
get
into
trouble
by

has
taken

''
``
Well
?

He
took
to
his
heels
,
and
was
soon
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
;
but
instead
of
going
into
the
saloon
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
,
he
asked
to
be
introduced
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
office
.
``
<NUMBER>
minutes
past
<NUMBER>
!
''
But
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
''
He
consequently
sprang
up
again
,
re-entered
the
office
,
with
a
turn
of
his
finger
set
the
clock
right
again
,
that
it
might
not
be
perceived
the
next
day
that
it
had
been
put
wrong
,
and
certain
from
that
time
that
he
had
a
witness
to
prove
his
<UNK>
,
he
ran
downstairs
and
soon
found
himself
in
the
street
.
For
an
apprentice
Musketeer
the
young
woman
was
almost
an
ideal
of
love
.
We
have
observed
that
young
cavaliers
received
presents
from
their
king
without
shame
.
Such
as
were
rich
gave
in
addition
a
part
of
their
money
;
and
a
vast
number
of
heroes
of
that
gallant
period
may
be
<UNK>
who
would
neither
have
won
their
spurs
in
the
first
place
,
nor
their
battles
afterward
,
without
the
purse
,
more
or
less
furnished
,
which
their
mistress
fastened
to
the
saddle
bow
.
But
,
we
must
say
,
at
the
present
moment
D'Artagnan
was
ruled
by
as
feeling
much
more
noble
and
disinterested
.
A
fine
and
white
<UNK>
,
a
silken
robe
,
a
lace
<UNK>
,
a
pretty
<UNK>
on
the
foot
,
a
<UNK>
ribbon
on
the
head
do
not
make
an
ugly
woman
pretty
,
but
they
make
a
pretty
woman
beautiful
,
without
reckoning
the
hands
,
which
gain
by
all
this
;
the
hands
,
among
women
particularly
,
to
be
beautiful
must
be
idle
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
disposed
to
become
the
most
tender
of
lovers
,
was
at
the
same
time
a
very
devoted
friend
,
In
the
midst
of
his
amorous
projects
for
the
mercer
's
wife
,
he
did
not
forget
his
friends
.
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
Let
our
readers
reassure
themselves
.
As
he
found
himself
in
the
quarter
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
lived
,
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
pay
his
friend
a
visit
in
order
to
explain
the
motives
which
had
led
him
to
send
Planchet
with
a
request
that
he
would
come
instantly
to
the
mousetrap
.
We
must
never
look
for
discretion
in
first
love
.
It
was
delightful
weather
.
The
house
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
dwelt
was
situated
between
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
D'Artagnan
was
perplexed
.
Oh
,
yes
!
This
was
neither
long
nor
difficult
.
But
on
my
soul
,
it
looks
so
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
believed
this
cough
to
be
a
signal
.
The
<NUMBER>
blows
were
scarcely
struck
,
when
the
inside
blind
was
opened
and
a
light
appeared
through
the
panes
of
the
outside
shutter
.
We
shall
see
the
windows
open
,
and
the
lady
enter
by
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
this
could
not
last
long
,
and
continued
to
look
with
all
his
eyes
and
listen
with
all
his
ears
.
Unfortunately
the
light
had
been
removed
into
another
chamber
;
but
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
were
accustomed
to
the
night
.
This
immediately
recalled
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mind
the
handkerchief
which
he
had
found
at
the
feet
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
had
reminded
him
of
that
which
he
had
dragged
from
under
the
feet
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<UNK>
prevailed
over
prudence
;
and
profiting
by
the
preoccupation
into
which
the
sight
of
the
handkerchief
appeared
to
have
plunged
the
<NUMBER>
personages
now
on
the
scene
,
he
stole
from
his
hiding
place
,
and
quick
as
lightning
,
but
stepping
with
utmost
caution
,
he
ran
and
placed
himself
close
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
,
from
which
his
eye
could
pierce
the
interior
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
.
Then
some
words
were
spoken
by
the
<NUMBER>
women
.
The
suspicion
that
it
was
she
had
crossed
the
mind
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
she
drew
the
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
;
but
what
probability
was
there
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
sent
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
order
to
be
reconducted
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
should
be
running
about
the
streets
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
half
past
eleven
at
night
,
at
the
risk
of
being
abducted
a
second
time
?
This
was
a
question
the
young
man
asked
himself
,
whom
the
demon
of
jealousy
already
gnawed
,
being
in
heart
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
accepted
lover
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
after
her
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
her
by
passing
his
arm
round
her
waist
;
but
as
he
felt
by
her
weight
she
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
,
he
made
haste
to
reassure
her
by
protestations
of
devotedness
.
``
Was
it
with
that
intention
you
followed
me
?
''
``
<NUMBER>
of
your
friends

Who
is
he

``

''
Besides

you
must
have
seen
that

I
spoke

''
``
But
who
is
she

''
``
No

Arriving
there
,
the
young

seemed
to
hesitate
,
as
she
had
before
done
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

deeply
piqued

cried
the
commissary
.
It

not

hope

``
Because
that

In
the
evening
,
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
at
the

he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
bed
,
he
heard
steps
in
his
corridor
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

follow

It
is

nevertheless

the

He
passed
along
the

corridor
as
before
,
crossed
<NUMBER>
court
,
then
a
second
side
of
a
building
;
at
length
,
at

gate
of
the
entrance
court
he
found
a
carriage
surrounded
by
<NUMBER>
guards
on
horseback

At
the
moment
of
arriving
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
the
spot
where
such

<PROPER_NOUN>
were
executed

he
was
near
fainting
and
crossed
himself
twice
.
<NUMBER>
thing
,
however
,
reassured
him
;
he
remembered
that
before
they
were
buried
their
heads
were
generally
cut
off
,
and
he
felt
that
his
head
was
still
on
his
shoulders
.
If
they
meant
to
execute
him
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
could
scarcely
be
worth
while
to
gag
him
,
as
they
had
nearly
reached
the
place
of
execution
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
flattered
himself
in
believing
himself
worthy
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
of

;
it
was
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<UNK>
that
his
journey
and
his
destiny
were
about
to
end

The
crowd
was
caused
,
not
by
the
expectation
of
a
man
to
be
hanged
,
but
by
the
contemplation
of
a
man
who
was
hanged
.
All
these
movements
had
been
effected
mechanically
,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
.
On
looking
around
him
,
however
,
as
he
could
perceive
no
threatening
object
,
as
nothing
indicated
that
he
ran
any
real
danger
,
as
the
bench
was
comfortably
covered
with
a

cushion
,
as
the

was
ornamented
with

<PROPER_NOUN>
leather
,
and
as
large
red
damask
curtains
,
fastened
back
by
gold
clasps
,
floated
before
the
window
,
he
perceived
by
degrees
that
his
fear
was
exaggerated
,
and
he
began
to
turn
his
head
to
the
right
and
the
left
,
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
.
``
Is
your
name

''
And
he
moved
out
of
the
way
to
let
the
mercer
pass
.
<UNK>
before
the
chimney
was
a
man
of
middle
height
,
of
a
haughty

proud
mien
;
with
piercing
eyes
,
a

brow
,
and

which
was

by

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as

is
now
called

,
surmounted
by

mustaches
.
At

sight
,
nothing
denoted
the

;
and
it
was
impossible
for
those
who
did
not
know
his
face
to
guess
in

they
were

``

responded
the

,
``

with
violence

repressed
another

At
these

he
took
up
a

bell

and
rang
it
;
the
officer
entered
.
``
Let

come

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rolling
his

round
in
astonishment

''
The
cardinal
being
left
alone
,
reflected
for
an
instant
and
then
rang
the
bell
a
third
time
.
``
You
have
deceived

``
Then
why
did

go

I
told
my

several

that
it
was
surprising
that
linen
drapers
should
live
in
such
houses
as
those
,
in
houses
that
had
no
signs
;
but
she
always
laughed
at
me
.
``
The
cardinal
has
touched
me
with
his
hand
!
``
Yes
,
my
friend
,
yes

''
said
the
cardinal
,
with
that
paternal
tone
which
he
sometimes
knew
how
to
assume
,
but
which
deceived
none
who
knew
him
;
``
and
as
you
have
been
unjustly

be

And
the
cardinal
made
him
a
sign
with
his
hand
,
to
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
by
bowing
to
the
ground
.
The
cardinal
listened
with
a
smile
to
this
vociferous
manifestation
of
the
feelings
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
then
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
cries
were
no
longer
audible
,
``
Good

''
``
Well

cried
the
cardinal
,
looking
at
the
clock
;
``

now

rang

he
,

The
lowest
or
the
least
known
of
them
,
as
soon
as
he
assumed
the
uniform
of
the
company
,
was
as
sure
of
his
aid
and
support
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
brother
.
We
were
present
at
the
scene
in
which
the
<NUMBER>
captives
were
confronted
with
each
other
.
The
second
commissary
was
as
much
bewildered
as
the
first
had
been
by
the
simple
and
firm
declaration
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
upon
whom
he
was
anxious
to
take
the
revenge
which
men
of
the
robe
like
at
all
times
to
gain
over
men
of
the
sword
;
but
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
commanded
a
little
reflection
.
It
is
well
known
how
violent
the
king
's
prejudices
were
against
the
queen
,
and
how
carefully
these
prejudices
were
kept
up
by
the
cardinal
,
who
in
affairs
of
intrigue
mistrusted
women
infinitely
more
than
men
.
At
the
first
word
the
cardinal
spoke
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
who
,
though
exiled
to
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
believed
to
be
in
that
city
,
had
come
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
remained
there
<NUMBER>
days
,
and
<UNK>
the
police
-
the
king
flew
into
a
furious
passion
.
And
yet
,
in
all
this
,
the
cardinal
had
not
yet
said
a
word
about
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
You
arrive
in
good
time
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
king
,
who
,
when
his
passions
were
raised
to
a
certain
point
,
could
not
dissemble
;
``
I
have
learned
some
fine
things
concerning
your
Musketeers
.
''
``
I
have
the
honor
to
inform

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
the
same
tone
,
``

The

of

who
could
not

her
for
having
repulsed
a

the

her

It
was
at
the
moment
when
she
was
plunged
in
the
deepest
and
darkest
of
these
reflections
that
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
,
and
the
king
entered
.
``

he
,
``

When
the

appeared

the

On

the

unable

shut

so

as

prevent
the

fled
from
entering
with

He
<UNK>
the

with

prayers
offered
up
by
the

By

they
did
nothing

ascend

the

led
to
the

at
night

For
form
's
sake
the

paid
a
visit
to
the
pieces
of
furniture
named
;
but
he
well
knew
that
it
was
not
in
a
piece
of

that
the
queen
would
place
the
important

she
had
written
that

asked
the

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height

and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
chancellor
with
an
expression
almost
threatening
.
I
have
written
a
letter
today
;
that
letter
is
not

gone

``
I
will
give
it

``
How
!
cried
the
queen
.
``
The
king
commands
it
,
madame

excuse
me

The
chancellor
made
a
profound
reverence
.
Without
doubt
the
chancellor
,
<UNK>
looked
about
at
that
moment
for
the
rope
of
the
famous
bell
;
but
not
finding
it
he
summoned
his
resolution
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hands
toward
the
place
where
the
queen
had
acknowledged
the
paper
was
to
be
found
.
The
chancellor
,
who
,
on
his
part
,
trembled
with
an
emotion
easily
to
be
conceived
,
took
the
letter
,
bowed
to
the
ground
,
and
retired
.
It
was
nothing
but
a
plan
of
attack
against
the
cardinal
.
``
There

said
he
,

the

who
,
in
his
joy
at
finding
the
queen
guilty
of
a
crime
which
he
cared
little
about
,
and
innocent
of
a
fault
of
which
he
had
great
dread

was
ready
to
make
up
all
<UNK>
with
her
,
``

upon

you
are

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
the
<UNK>
of
her
letter
,
expected
reproaches
,
was
much
astonished
the
next
day
to
see
the
king
make
some
attempts
at
reconciliation
with
her
.
A
fete
was
so
rare
a
thing
for
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
at
this
announcement
,
as
the
cardinal
had
predicted
,
the
last
trace
of
her
resentment
disappeared
,
if
not
from
her
heart
at

from
her
countenance
.
On
the
eighth
day
after
the
scene
we
have
described
,
the
cardinal
received
a
letter
with
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
stamp
which
only
contained
these
lines
:
``
I
have
them

<UNK>
is
the
twentieth
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

It
was
the
second
time
the
cardinal
had
mentioned
these
diamond
studs
to
the
king
.
He
went
then
to
the
queen
,
and
according
to
custom
accosted
her
with
fresh
menaces
against
those
who
surrounded
her
.
``
But
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

tired
of
these
vague
attacks
,
``
but
,
sire
,
you
do
not

me

The
king

attacked
in
a
manner
so
direct
,
did
not
know
what
to
answer
;
and
he
thought
that
this
was
the
moment
for
expressing
the
desire
which
he
was
not

made
until
the
evening
before
the
fete

The
answer
was
terrible
.
``
You
hear
,

?
''
``
With
those
studs
?
''
``
But
on
what

More
closely
watched
than
ever
,
the
queen
felt
certain
,
without
knowing
how
to
tell
which
,
that
<NUMBER>
of
her
women
had
betrayed
her
.
said
all
at
once
a
voice
full
of
sweetness
and
pity
.
The
queen
uttered
a
piercing
cry
at
finding
herself
surprised
-
for
in
her
trouble
she
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
young
woman
who
had
been
given
to
her
by
<PROPER_NOUN>

cried
the
queen
;
``
but
look
me
in

cried
the

,
falling
on
her
knees
;
``
upon
my
soul
,
I
am
ready
to
die
for

''
Those
studs
were
enclosed
in
a
little
rosewood
box
which
he
held
under
his
arm
?
murmured
the
queen
,
whose
teeth
chattered
with
fright
.
``
Someone

be
sent

``
But
I
must
write

must

and
I
will
save
them
all

''
I
have
not
yet
had
time
to
see
him
again
.
The
queen
took
the
<NUMBER>
hands
of
the
young
woman
with
a
burst
of
emotion
,
gazed
at
her
as
if
to
read
her
very
heart
,
and
seeing
nothing
but
sincerity
in
her
beautiful
eyes
,
embraced
her
tenderly
.
``

said
the
queen
,
``

said
the
queen
,
``
we
are
forgetting

she
,
``

``

the

she

As
to
the
servant
,
she
had
run
away
at
the
moment
of
her
master
's
arrest
.
This
was
the
more
so
because
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
reflections
were
all
rose-colored
.
In
spite
of
herself
her
thoughts
constantly
reverted
to
that
handsome
young
man
who
was
so
brave
and
appeared
to
be
so
much
in

There
was

enough

emboldened
by
the
first
exploit

sprang
upon

;
and
being
strong
and
vigorous
,
he
soon
got
him
on
the
broad
of
his
back
,
and
placed
his
knee
upon
his
breast
.
At
the
third
hit
the
gentleman
fell
like
a
log
.
This

the
gentleman
closed
his
eyes
and
fainted
.
But
he
was
soon
aroused
from
these
reflections
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
uttered
loud
cries
and
screamed
for
help
with
all
his

In

held

at

within

wood
,
it
was
evident
they
were

remain
there
till
the
next
day

Let

attend
to
what
is
more
pressing
first

then
we

attend
to
my

it

said
the

Most

;

It
was

;
for
they
had
scarcely
sailed
half
a
league
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
a

and
heard
a
<UNK>
.
The
point

had
touched
a

,
and
glanced
along
the
bone
.
He
threw
himself
upon
it
,
and
fell
asleep
.
But
that
was
not
all
;
they
must
get
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
D'Artagnan
did
not
know
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
did
not
know
a
word
of

but
he
wrote
the

on

and
everyone
pointed
out

the

He

<PROPER_NOUN>
at

remembered

suspecting
that

was
going

<PROPER_NOUN>
of
which
it
was
necessary
he
should
be

he
only
took
the

to
inquire
where
the

was

and
recognizing
from

the

of

he
put
his

into

rode

By
adding
all
that
he
heard
from

of

to
his

he
was
enabled

the

went
like

they
were
at

D'Artagnan
followed
him
amid
cries

<UNK>
by

D'Artagnan
followed

On

was

``

The

went
out
with

showed

without

``
We

turning

D'Artagnan
looked
with
stupefaction
at
a
man
who
thus
employed
the
unlimited
power
with
which
he
was
clothed
by
the
confidence
of
a
king
in
the
prosecution

his
intrigues

She
asked

the

promised

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
amazed
to
note
by
what
<UNK>
and
unknown
threads
the
destinies
of
nations
and
the

suspended

The
goldsmith
cast
a
glance
at
the
elegant
manner
in
which
they
were
set
,
calculated
,
<NUMBER>
with
another
,
what
the

were
worth

without

said

he
.
As
to
the
goldsmith
,
he
wrote
to
his

,
sending
her
the
order
for
the

pistoles
,
and
charging
her
to
send
him

in

his

,
an

,
of
which
he
gave

the

This

settled
,
the
duke
turned
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
A

In

Besides

blushed
up
to

the

found
the

went

easily
discovered

received
him
as

had
seen
him
that

morning
;
only
,
when
pressing
his

a

more
warmly
than

he
informed

At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
arrived

It
was
the

passing

led
from

the

de

and
which
were
all
illuminated

A
private
room
had
been
prepared
for
the
king

another
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

Before
entering
his
closet
the
king
desired
to
be
informed
the
moment
the
cardinal
arrived
.
At
the
moment
she
entered
,
the
curtain
of
a
small
gallery
which
to
that

had
been
closed

was
drawn
,
and
the
pale
face

appeared
,
he
being

as

cavalier

The

was
speaking
to
him
in

voice
,
and
the
king
was
very
pale
.
``
Sire

''
replied
the
queen
,
with
a
faltering
voice
,
``
because

in

midst
of

I
feared

''
The
voice
of
the
king
was
tremulous
with
anger
.
The
queen
bent
in
token
of
submission
,
and
followed
the
ladies
who
were
to
conduct
her
to
her
room
.
The
violins
began
to
sound
with
all
their
might
,
but
nobody
listened
to
them

So
dressed

he
really
appeared
the

demanded
he
of
the
cardinal
.
It
is
true
that
the
habit
of
a
<UNK>
became
her
admirably
.
The
queen
had
them

They
took
their
places
,
and
the
ballet
began

The
ballet
ended
amid
the
applause
of
the

and
everyone
reconducted
his
lady
to
her
place
;
but
the

took
advantage

had

to
advance

the

affecting
surprise

asked
the

in
a
severe
tone
.
The
attention
which
we
have
been
obliged
to
give
,
during
the
commencement
of
the
chapter
,
to
the
illustrious
personages
we
have
introduced
into

,
has
diverted
us
for
an
instant
from
him
to
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
owed
the
extraordinary
triumph
she
had
obtained
over
the
cardinal
;
and
who
,
confounded

unknown
,
lost
in
the
crowd
gathered
at
<NUMBER>
of
the

looked
on
at
this
scene
,
<UNK>
only
to
<NUMBER>
persons
-
the
king

the
queen

his
Eminence

and
himself

On
the
evening
before
,
they
had
scarcely
seen
each
other
for
a
moment
at
the
apartment
of
the
Swiss
guard
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whither
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
sent
for
her
.
At
length
,
after
winding
about
for
a
minute
or
<NUMBER>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
the
door
of
a
closet
,
which
was
entirely
dark
,
and
led
<PROPER_NOUN>
into
it
.
The
young
man
waited
in
<UNK>
darkness
and
listened
.
He
heard
her
approach
and
withdraw
from
the
partially
open
door
;
and
twice
or
<NUMBER>
times
he
even
saw
the
shadow
of
a
person
intercept
the
light
.
Then
the
hand
was
withdrawn
,
leaving
in
his
an
object
which
he
perceived
to
be
a
ring
.
Besides
,
although
the
ballet
was
danced
,
the
evening
had
scarcely
begun
.
``
You
at
last
?
''
``
But
where
and
when
shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
At
these
words
she
opened
the
door
of
the
corridor
,
and
pushed
<PROPER_NOUN>
out
of
the
room
.
He
found
the
door
of
his
passage
open
,
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
knocked
softly
in
a
manner
agreed
upon
between
him
and
his
lackey
.
In
the
intervening
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
perhaps
sent
him
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
did
the
horses
.
``
What
do
you
mean

blockhead

It
is
not
natural
for
letters
to
enter
people
's
houses
in
this
manner
.
It
was
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
was
expressed
in
these
terms
:
``
There
are
many
thanks

be
offered

be
transmitted
to

His
heart

swelled
by
the
intoxication

joy

felt
ready

<UNK>
away
at
the
very
gate
of
that
terrestrial

``

The

departed

A

,
at

which
was
the

,
ran
along
<NUMBER>
side
of
this
lane
,
and
on
the

was
a
little
garden
connected
with
a

which
was
protected
by

from

Beyond

,
a
dark
mist
enveloped
with
its

that
immensity
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
slept
-
a
vast
void
from
which
glittered
a

luminous
points
,
the
funeral
stars
of

!
There
was
something
melancholy
in
this
<UNK>
voice
pouring
out
its
lamentations
in
the
middle
of
the
night
;
but
each
of
those
strokes
,
which
made
up
the
expected

,
vibrated
<UNK>
to
the
heart
of
the
young

.
<UNK>
in
this
sweet
idea
,
D'Artagnan
waited
half
an
hour
without
the

impatience
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
charming

abode
of
which
he
could
perceive
a
part
of
the
ceiling
with
its
gilded
moldings
,
<UNK>
the
elegance
of
the
rest
of
the
apartment
.
Then
the
idea
seized
him
that
he
had
read
<UNK>
,
and
that
the
appointment
was
for
eleven
o'clock
.
D'Artagnan
began
now
really
to
fear
that
something
had
happened
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
that
moment
he
thought
of
the
trees
,
upon
whose
leaves
the
light
still
shone
;
and
as
<NUMBER>
of
them
<UNK>
over
the
road
,
he
thought
that
from
its
branches
he
might
get
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
.
It
was
a
strange
thing
,
and
<NUMBER>
which
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
tremble
from
the
sole
of
his
foot
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
,
to
find
that
this
soft
light
,
this
calm
lamp
,
enlightened
a
scene
of
fearful
disorder
.
Everything
in
the
apartment
gave
evidence
of
a
violent
and
desperate
struggle
.
D'Artagnan
then
perceived
a
thing
that
he
had
not
before
remarked
-
for
nothing
had
led
him
to
the
examination
-
that
the
ground
,
trampled
here
and
<UNK>
there
,
presented
confused
traces
of
men
and
horses
.
It
was
<NUMBER>
of
those
perfumed
gloves
that
lovers
like
to
snatch
from
a
pretty
hand
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
became
almost
wild
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
advantage
of
the
lamp
which
burned
in
the
cabin
of
the
<UNK>
to
read
the
billet
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
once
again
,
and
satisfy
himself
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
,
that
the
appointment
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
not
elsewhere
,
before
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
's
pavilion
and
not
in
another
street
.
The
lane
was
still
deserted
,
and
the
same
calm
soft
light
shone
through
the
window
.
A
silence
of
death
reigned
in
the
cabin
as
in
the
pavilion
;
but
as
the
cabin
was
his
last
resource
,
he
knocked
again
.
Nevertheless
,
rapid
as
the
movement
had
been
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
had
time
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
head
of
an
old
man
.
Has
anything
particular
happened
in
the
neighborhood
?
He
told
how
he
had
a
rendezvous
with
a
young
woman
before
that
pavilion
,
and
how
,
not
seeing
her
come
,
he
had
climbed
the
<UNK>
tree
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
had
seen
the
disorder
of
the
chamber
.
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
explain
yourself

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
the
shadow
was
a

some

said
he
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader

the
party
.
At
these
words
he
threw
me
a
crown
,
which
I
picked
up
,
and
he
took
the
ladder
.
The

remained

got

From

I

``

And
the

''
``
Some

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
And

Sometimes

At

then
,
as
we
said

<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
,
asked
for
a
bottle
of
wine
of
the
best
quality

and
placing
himself
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
,
determined
thus
to
wait
till
daylight
;
but
this
time
again
his
hopes
were
disappointed
,
and
although
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
,
he
heard
nothing
,
amid
the
oaths

coarse
jokes
,
and
abuse
which
passed
between
the
laborers
,
servants
,
and
<UNK>
who
comprised
the
honorable
society
of
which
he
formed
a
part
,
which
could
put
him
upon
the
least
track
of
her
who
had
been
stolen
from
him
.
He
was
not
long
in
making
his
toilet
.
This
time
he
had
decided
to
relate
all
that
had
passed
.
When
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
finished
,
he
said
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

that

he
more

the

Then
a
sudden
idea
crossed
the
mind

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
However
,
the
revolution
which
appeared
upon
his
countenance
was
so
visible
that

was
terrified
at

and
he
endeavored
to
draw

but
as
he
was
standing
before
the

the

entered

It
followed
that
his

procured
him
some

from

Perhaps
it

The

desired

<PROPER_NOUN>
perceiving

ordered

``
Well

I

I
slipped

in

a

I
practiced
this
exercise
,
and
as
nature
has
endowed
me
with
some
faculties

at

I
can
throw
the

what

entered

were
sufficiently
refreshed

Besides

it
was
necessary

should
stay
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
wait
for
the
answer

Consequently
he
had
appeared
to
believe
all
that

Musketeer
had
told
him

convinced
that
no

will
hold
out
against

thought
of
that
young

pretty

was
to
have
paid
him
the
price
of
his
devotedness

let
us
hasten
to
say
that
this
sadness
possessed
the

less
from
the
regret

the
happiness
he
had
missed

from
the
fear
he
entertained
that
some
serious
misfortune
had
befallen
the

<UNK>
existence
then
resembles
a
sleep
of
which
this
thought
is
the
dream
.
It
was
as
a
prey
to
this
<UNK>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
traveled
,
at
whatever
pace
his
horse
pleased
,
the
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
leagues
that
separated
<PROPER_NOUN>
from

without
his
being
able
to
remember
on

any

or
met
with
on

<NUMBER>
evening
I

he

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
being

went
into

Her

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
been
laying
out
much
money
upon

residence
;
which
proved
that
the
general
measure
which
drove
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
affect
her
.
The
brother
did
not
perceive
this
;
he
had
turned
round
to
play
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
favorite
monkey
,
which
had
pulled
him
by
the
doublet

The
blood
rose
to
her
head
,
and
her
little
foot
worked
with
impatience
beneath
her
robe
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
it
was
considered
<UNK>
by
an

refuse

She
bit
her
handkerchief
with
her
beautiful
teeth
.
Her
countenance
,
with
surprising
<UNK>
,
had
recovered
its
gracious
expression
;
but
some
little
red
spots
on
her
handkerchief
indicated
that

bitten
her
lips
till
the
blood
came

She
told
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de

In
addition
to
this
,
after
a
half
hour
's
conversation
D'Artagnan
was
convinced
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
his
compatriot
;
she
spoke
French
with
an
elegance

a
purity
that
left
no

head

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
leave

left
the

She
appeared
to
take
a

asked
him
whence

came

who
were
his

and
whether

had
not
sometimes
thought

<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
that
he
had
been
sent

<PROPER_NOUN>
to
treat

and
that

She
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
kindness
which
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
preoccupied
by

mistress
that
he
noticed
absolutely
nothing

her

However
brilliant
had
been
the
part
played
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
duel
,
it
had
not
made
him
forget
the
dinner
of
the
procurator

wife

He
was
about
at

to
pass
that
mysterious
threshold

to
climb
those

stairs
by
which
,
<NUMBER>
by
<NUMBER>
,
the
old
crowns

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
ascended

The
Musketeer
could
not
forget
the
evil
reports

then
prevailed

and
which

have
survived

of

meanness

<UNK>

as

after
all

excepting
some
few
acts

economy
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
always
found
very
<UNK>
,
the
procurator

wife
had
been
tolerably
liberal
-
that
is

be
it
understood
,
for
a
procurator
's
wife
-
he
hoped
to
see
a
household
of
a
highly
comfortable
kind
.
A
tall
,
pale
clerk
,
his
face
shaded
by
a
forest
of
virgin
hair
,
opened
the
door
,
and
bowed
with
the
air
of
a
man
forced
at
once
to
respect
in
another
lofty
stature
,
which
indicated
strength

rank

and
a
<UNK>
countenance

which
indicated
familiarity

good

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
entered
the
office
from
the
house
at
the

her
guest
entered
from

stairs

the
appearance

relieved

from

On
quitting

study
they
left
the
kitchen
on

right

and
entered
the
reception
room

The
procurator
had
without

been
warned
of
his
visit
,
as
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
the
sight

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
advanced
toward
him
with
a
sufficiently
easy
air
,
and
saluted
him
courteously

His

gray
eyes
shone
like

and
appeared

with

mouth

to
be

survived

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
firm
upon

would
have
declined

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
feel
the
ridicule

this

and
took
it
for
a
piece

simplicity

at

he
laughed
in
his
large
mustache

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
carry

any

withdrawing

fixing

he
contented

ate

This

turned

ventured
a

at

I

so

indisposed

I

To

it
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
became
as

suspected

completed

kissed

opened

from

As

his

at

<PROPER_NOUN>

passed
through

herself
reconducted
him
through

<UNK>
made

she

taking

And
then
accompanying

``

opening

This
woman
is
certainly
a
great
liar
.
In
an
instant
D'Artagnan
perceived
that
the
best
way
in
which
he
could
act
would
be
to
go
home
and
write
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
long
letter
,
in
which
he
would
confess
to
her
that
he
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
,
up
to
the
present
moment
absolutely
the
same
,
and
that
consequently
he
could
not
undertake
,
without
committing
suicide
,
to
kill
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
evident
that
this
time
the
young
woman
was
not
in
such
haste
to
retire
to
her
apartment
as
she
had
been
the
first
.
The
poor
girl
,
pale
as
death
and
trembling
in
all
her
limbs
,
wished
to
delay
her
lover
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
her
ear
on
the
watch
,
had
heard
the
noise
D'Artagnan
had
made
,
and
opening
the
door
,
said
,
``
Come
in
.
''
As
the
door
closed
after
them
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
toward
it
.
It
was
no
longer
a
rival
who
was
beloved
;
it
was
himself
who
was
apparently
beloved
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
no
longer
for
him
that
woman
of
fatal
intentions
who
had
for
a
moment
terrified
him
;
she
was
an
ardent
,
passionate
mistress
,
abandoning
herself
to
love
which
she
also
seemed
to
feel
.
This
coldness
toward
the
only
interests
that
occupied
her
mind
terrified
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
questions
became
more
pressing
.
But
at
the
first
word
the
young
woman
started
,
and
exclaimed
in
a
sharp
,
bantering
tone
.
``
At
all
events
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seriously
,
``
he
has
deceived
me
,
and
from
the
moment

deceived
me
,
he
merited
death

''
We
can
not
say
how
long
the
night
seemed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
believed
it
to
be
hardly
<NUMBER>
hours
before
the
daylight
peeped
through
the
window
blinds
,
and
invaded
the
chamber
with
its
paleness
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Thanks

my
brave
lover

but
as
you

satisfy

``
Why

wounded

killed

''
Milady
looked
at
her
lover
in
silence
.
I
think
that
a
man
must
be
so
severely
punished
by
the
loss
of
your

that
he
stands
in
need

no

''
``
You

``
That

appears

``
Yes

I
am

determined
to
come
to
an
end

``

I
not

``
If
I
had
the

not
make

<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
with
his
sweetest
smile
to
touch
his
lips
to

,
but
she
<UNK>
him
.
It
is
not
true

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
so
firm
,
and
with
a
countenance
so
<UNK>
,
that
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
in
such
perfect
possession
of
the
fact
,
he
would
have
doubted

kill
me

''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
can
not
boast
of
anything

''
The
imprudent
young
man
expected
a
surprise
,
mixed
with
shame
-
a
slight
storm
which
would
resolve
itself
into
tears
;
but
he
was
strangely
deceived
,
and
his
error
was
not
of
long
duration
.
Then
the
cambric
was
torn
from
her
beautiful
shoulders
;
and
on
<NUMBER>
of
those
lovely
shoulders
,
round
and
white
,
D'Artagnan
recognized
,
with
inexpressible
astonishment
,
the
FLEUR-DE-LIS
-
that
indelible
mark
which
the
hand
of
the
infamous
executioner
had
imprinted
.
He
had
doubtless
seen
all
.
cried
she
,
``
you
have
<UNK>
betrayed
me
,
and
still
more
,
you
have
my
secret
!
He
recoiled
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
he
would
have
done
from
a
serpent
which
was
<UNK>
toward
him
,
and
his
sword
coming
in
contact
with
his
nervous
hand
,
he
drew
it
almost
unconsciously
from
the
scabbard
.
As
all
this
,
however
,
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
duel
,
D'Artagnan
began
to
recover
himself
little
by
little
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
still
keeping
on
the
defensive
,
drew
near
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
door
.
Then
Milady
attempted
to
tear
down
the
<UNK>
,
with
a
strength
apparently
above
that
of
a
woman
;
but
finding
she
could
not
accomplish
this
,
she
in
her
fury
stabbed
at
the
door
with
her
poniard
,
the
point
of
which
repeatedly
glittered
through
the
wood
.
``
But
you
ca
n't
go
out
so
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
you
are
naked

''
In
a
turn
of
the
hand
she
muffled
him
up
in
a
<UNK>
robe
,
a
large
hood
,
and
a
cloak
.
The
porter
was
drawing
the
cord
at
the
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
cried
from
her
window
,
``
Do
n't
open

''
The
confusion
of
his
mind
,
the
terror
which
spurred
him
on
,
the
cries
of
some
of

At

Their

preserved
the

At

resplendent

As

seen

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
approved

let

At
length
,
after
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
just
as
twilight
was
beginning
to
<UNK>
,
a
carriage
appeared

coming
at

injunction
given

<PROPER_NOUN>
put

into

overtook

closed

disappeared

<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
fixed

astounded

But

was
at
the

impetuous

curious

There
only
they
explained

the
matter
in

<PROPER_NOUN>

on

entered
boldly
at

placed
his

usher
on
duty

led
him
into

waiting
room

passed
on

made

follow

standing

examined

trembled

likewise
recollected

passed
close

carried
away

bowed
with
respect

''
``
Well

This
last
expression

conveyed
a
terrible
doubt
;
it
alarmed
<PROPER_NOUN>
more
than
a

done

it
was
a
warning

Then
the
noble

crossed
his

;

made
the
compact

<UNK>
home
with

inquired
eagerly
the

confined

<PROPER_NOUN>
sighed
deeply

for
this
voice
responded
to
a
secret
voice
of
his
soul
,
which
told
him
that
great
misfortunes

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
contented
himself

answered

extreme

He

decided

setting

in

of
the

he
persisted

the
disease

to
lay
hold
upon

magnificent
;
his
spurs
<UNK>
,
his

glittered

knocked
proudly
against
his
ample
limbs

He
whispered
a
hope
to
himself
that
this
beloved

might
be
killed
in
the
field
.
But
the
real
adieux
were
made
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
chamber
;
they
were
heartrending
.
To
whom
?
In
the
meantime
D'Artagnan
was
<UNK>
with
his
company
.
The
<NUMBER>
men
followed
the
company
,
and
on
leaving
the
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
mounted
<NUMBER>
horses
properly
equipped
,
which
a
servant
without

had
waiting
for
them
.
Let
us
<UNK>
them
first
,
and
then
pass
on
to
the
private
plans
which
perhaps
had
not
less
influence
upon
his
Eminence
than
the
others
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
had
derived
a
new
importance
from
the
ruin
of
the
other
<UNK>
cities
,
was
,
then
,
the
focus
of
dissensions
and
ambition
.
The
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
to
him
the
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

the
taking
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
preface
to
the
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
That
we
are
not
able
to
say
;
but
at
all
events
,
we
have
seen
,
by
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
this
story
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
the
advantage
over
him
,
and
in
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
circumstances
,
particularly
that
of
the
diamond
studs
,
had
,
thanks
to
the
devotedness
of
the
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
the
courage
and
conduct
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
cruelly
<UNK>
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
also
was
pursuing
a
private
vengeance
.
Arriving
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
<NUMBER>
vessels
and
nearly
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
men
,
he
had
surprised
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
commanded
for
the
king
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
he
had
,
after
a
bloody
conflict
,
effected
his
landing
.
It
was
of
this
detachment
,
sent
as
a
<UNK>
,
that
our
friend
D'Artagnan
formed
a
part
.
It
followed
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
as
yet
purely
and
simply
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
found
himself
,
for
the
time
at
least
,
separated
from
his
good
friends
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
masters
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
continued
to
<UNK>
,
but
without
success
,
the
citadel
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
fort
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
<UNK>
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
commenced
,
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
days
before
,
about
a
fort
which
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
caused
to
be
constructed
near
the
city
.
As
to
love
,
the
only
woman
he
could
have
loved
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
disappeared
,
without
his
being
able
to
discover
what
had
become
of
her
.
Then
he
had
made
himself
another
enemy
,
less
to
be
feared
,
he
thought
;
but
nevertheless
,
he
instinctively
felt
,
not
to
be
despised
.
We
say
the
gravel
he
trod
under
his
feet
,
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
these
reflections
while
walking
<UNK>
along
a
pretty
little
road
which
led
from
the
camp
to
the
village
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
determined
,
therefore
,
to
direct
his
course
as
clear
from
it
as
he
could
when
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
from
behind
a
rock
,
he
perceived
the
extremity
of
another
musket
.
No
time
was
to
be
lost
.
``
If
there
is
a
third
shot
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
I
am
a
lost
man
.
''
This
event
might
have
<NUMBER>
causes
:
The
first
and
the
most
natural
was
that
it
might
be
an
ambuscade
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
might
not
be
sorry
to
kill
<NUMBER>
of
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
because
it
would
be
an
enemy
the
less
,
and
this
enemy
might
have
a
<UNK>
purse
in
his
pocket
.
This
could
not
,
then
,
be
a
military
ambuscade
,
as
the
ball
was
not
of
the
regular
<UNK>
.
For
people
toward
whom
he
had
but
to
put
forth
his
hand
,
his
Eminence
had
rarely
recourse
to
such
means
.
murmured
D'Artagnan
;
``
where
are
you
?
Nevertheless
,
day
dawned
without
darkness
having
brought
any
accident
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
visited
the
posts
.
He
waited
for
a
fresh
gesture
on
the
part
of
his
superior
,
for
fear
he
might
be
mistaken
;
but
this
gesture
being
repeated
,
he
left
the
ranks
,
and
advanced
to
receive
orders
.
In
fact
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
had
made
a
sortie
during
the
night
,
and
had
<UNK>
a
bastion
of
which
the
royal
army
had
gained
possession
<NUMBER>
days
before
.
``
<NUMBER>
men
of
good
will
who
will
risk
being
killed
with
me
!
''
It
was
not
know
whether
,
after
the
taking
of
the
bastion
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
<UNK>
it
or
left
a
garrison
in
it
;
the
object
then
was
to
examine
the
place
near
enough
to
verify
the
reports
.
He
thought
that
,
beginning
to
be
afraid
,
they
had
stayed
behind
,
and
he
continued
to
advance
.
They
knew
all
they
wished
to
know
;
the
bastion
was
guarded
.
A
ball
had
passed
through
his
breast
.
The
young
man
turned
quickly
round
,
for
this
attack
could
not
have
come
from
the
bastion
,
which
was
hidden
by
the
angle
of
the
trench
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
deceived
;
these
<NUMBER>
men
had
only
followed
for
the
purpose
of
<UNK>
him
,
hoping
that
the
young
man
's
death
would
be
placed
to
the
account
of
the
enemy
.
The
assassins
comprehended
that
if
they
fled
toward
the
camp
without
having
killed
their
man
,
they
should
be
accused
by
him
;
therefore
their
first
idea
was
to
join
the
enemy
.
Meantime
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
thrown
himself
upon
the
other
soldier
,
attacking
him
with
his
sword
.
``
Oh
,
do
not
kill
me
!
''
asked
the
young
man
,
<UNK>
his
arm
.
``
A
woman
whom
I
do
n't
know
,
but
who
is
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
``
But
how
did
you
become
concerned
in
this
<UNK>
affair
?
''
``
Well
,
come
!
''
I
understand
why
you
accepted
it
,
and
I
grant
you
my
pardon
;
but
upon
<NUMBER>
condition
.
''
``
But
,
''
cried
the
bandit
,
``
that
is
only
another
way
of
killing
me
.
In
the
name
of
that
young
lady
you
love
,
and
whom
you
perhaps
believe
dead
but
who
is
not
!
''
``
By
that
letter
which
my
comrade
has
in
his
pocket
.
''
cried
he
,
regaining
strength
by
force
of
terror
.
Terror
was
so
strongly
painted
on
his
face
,
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
pity
on
him
,
and
casting
upon
him
a
look
of
contempt
,
``
Stop
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
show
you
the
difference
between
a
man
of
courage
and
such
a
coward
as
you
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
preferred
the
second
means
,
and
lifted
the
assassin
onto
his
shoulders
at
the
moment
the
enemy
fired
.
A
leather
pocketbook
,
a
purse
,
in
which
was
evidently
a
part
of
the
sum
which
the
bandit
had
received
,
with
a
dice
box
and
dice
,
completed
the
possessions
of
the
dead
man
.
No
signature
.
``
But
what
were
you
to
do
with
that
woman
?
''
murmured
D'Artagnan
;
``
that
's
the
place
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
own
residence
!
''
Then
also
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
predicted
,
it
became
possible
to
find
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
a
convent
was
not
impregnable
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
who
could
scarcely
believe
in
such
<UNK>
,
``
but
is
it
not
to
have
me
hanged
?
''
They
were
therefore
much
astonished
and
delighted
in
the
regiment
when
they
saw
the
young
man
come
back
safe
and
sound
.
The
whole
army
talked
of
this
expedition
for
a
day
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
him
his
compliments
upon
it
.
After
the
most
<UNK>
news
of
the
king
's
health
,
a
report
of
his
<UNK>
began
to
prevail
in
the
camp
;
and
as
he
was
very
anxious
to
be
in
person
at
the
siege
,
it
was
said
that
as
soon
as
he
could
mount
a
horse
he
would
set
forward
.
But
<NUMBER>
morning
at
the
commencement
of
the
month
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
everything
was
explained
to
him
by
this

The

the

The

conversed

The

Milady
looked
at
this
man
,
and
hesitated
.
``

leaped
to

offered
his

to

``
Yes

replied
the

The
officer
saw
that
the
baggage
was
fastened
carefully
behind
the
carriage
;
and
this

ended

he
took
his

no

chasing

<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
to
open
the
door
in
order
to
throw
herself
out
.
The
<UNK>
creature
at
once
comprehended
that
she
was
<UNK>
herself
by
allowing
him
thus
to
read
her
soul
;
she
collected
her
features
,
and
in
a
complaining
voice
said
:
``
In

tell

Then
,
as
the
wheels
rolled
over
a
fine
gravel
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
hear
a
vast
roaring
,
which
she
at
once
recognized
as
the
noise
of
the
sea
dashing
against
some
steep
<UNK>
.
``
My

your
politeness

the

She
,
with
a
<UNK>
countenance
,
took
his
arm
,
and
passed
with
him
under
a
low
arched
door
,
which
by

vaulted
passage
,
lighted
only
at
the

end

led
to
a

staircase
around

stone

In
an

all
the
strength
of
mind
of
this
creature
,
though
drawn
from
the
most
vigorous
sources
,
abandoned
her

she
sank
into

chair

with

crossed

lowered
,
and
expecting
every

to
see

enter
to
interrogate
her
.
At
length
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
hold
out
no

;
she
broke
the
silence
.
If
I
am
free
,
why
these

and
these
doors
?
This

I
believe
I
have
accomplished

also
with

``
Can
you
not
tell

At
the

time
the
door
opened
;
a
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
.
Then
when
she
had
no

any

she
cried

in

stupor

``

my

``

``
Nearly

Then
,
turning
toward
the
door
,
and
seeing
that
the
young
officer
was
waiting
for
his
last
orders
,
he
said
.
How
had

discovered
her
arrival

and
caused
her
to
be
seized
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
have
guessed
that
it

``
Yes

she
,
with
a
kind
of
cheerfulness

decided

in

recollected

spared

looking

almost
starting
from

A

burst
from

asked
the

rising

going

backward

his

whence

The
cardinal
had
little
notes
thrown
over
in
which
he
represented
to
the

how
unjust

These

all
the

announced

such
were
the

which
made

find
these

so
long
to

to

them

Besides

he
had
another
strange
fancy
,
which
was
always
to
believe
that
the

created
the

His

took
a

with

advanced

he

without

when
a

made

attracted

the

These

pronounced
with

imperturbable
phlegm
which
distinguished

the

allowed

bowed

It

sank
upon

crushed

supported

feeling

arose
trembling

As
well

could
judge
by
the
light

the
day
was
already
two-thirds
gone

The
chamber
was
evidently
furnished
for
the
reception

the
most
finished
coquette
could
not

formed

she

casting

Then

he
advanced

I
sprang
toward

opening

feebly

streaming

At

threw
a

over

With

he
had
recognized
there

where

hovering
over

the

It

It

true

that

at

The

accompanied

<PROPER_NOUN>
;

there
the

At

the

D'Artagnan
examined

wore
an

Let

Accordingly

that

commenced

The

met
her

showed
her
the

After
breakfast

the

to
pay

She
tried

be
agreeable

winning
the

by

But
the

contented
herself
with
listening

smiling
without
replying

But
the

on

maintained

<UNK>
herself

pronounced

``

This

rather
royalist
than
cardinalist

``
<NUMBER>

``
And
you
have
reason

much

<PROPER_NOUN>
to
herself
;
``

It

The

looked
at

for
an

uneasiness

as

a
fresh
thought
suggested
itself
to
her

smiled
to
herself
at
the
idea

had
occurred
to
her
that

might
be

was
awakened

however

smiled
in
observing

But
at

the

touched

wrote

before
the
king

the
greatest
noble

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fallen
into
this
situation
by
habit
.
The
life
of
the
poor
prince
was
,
then
,
very
dull
.
He
on

,
in

was
his

was

<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
idlers
,
who
had
followed
the
cavalcade
to
the
castle
,
after
pointing
out
the
suspended
birds
to
each
other
,
dispersed
with
comments
upon
what
they
saw
:
and
,
when
they
were
gone
,
the
street
,
the
place
,
and
the
court
all
remained
deserted
alike
.
This
burst
of
laughter
proceeded
from
a
window
of
the
castle
,
visited
at
this
moment
by
the
sun
,
that
embraced
it
in
<NUMBER>
of
those
large
angles

out
upon

<NUMBER>
of
them

with
both
elbows
on

table

and
a

tracing

;

to

was
watching
her
companion
as
she
wrote
,
or
rather
hesitated
to
write
.
Her
every
movement
seemed
the
accent
of
a
<UNK>
nature
,
she
did
not
walk
-
she
bounded
.
``
Montalais

This
<UNK>
neither
made
the
young

called

to
laugh
and
gesticulate

!
The
fair
girl
at
length
became
quite
angry
;
she
tore
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
,
in
fact
,
the
words

were
written
in

and
crushing
the
paper
in
her
trembling

she
threw
it
out
of
the
window
.

the
jeering
brunette
,
still
laughing
.
there
is
the
bell
ringing
now
.
This
formality
being
accomplished
with
great
ceremony
,
the
husband
and
wife
breakfasted
,
and
then
separated
till
the
hour
of

She
then
held
the
pen
toward
her

and
with
a
charming
smile
encouraged
her
hand
,
which
quickly
traced
the

named

With

he
checked

in

middle
of

with

The

He

seen
at

rummaging

sketched
could
not
fail

being
taken
for
a
gentleman

and
of
the
best
class

This
apartment
was
that
which
composed
the
whole
front
of
the

house
,
a

salon
,
lighted
by
<NUMBER>
windows
on
the
first
stage

a

chamber
by

above
it

This

had
risen
early
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
this
history
begins
,
and
had
placed
himself
at

seated
upon

leaning

gazing
sadly

on

watching

no

As

was
rising

the

opened

<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
,
cap
in
hand

rather
bent

bowing

A

of

interrogated
him

without

being
pronounced
.
``

enter

remain

``

there
is
the

said
the

.

The
unknown
colored
;
the
idea
at
once
struck
him
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
poor
,
and
was
being
insulted
.
My
father
was
a
servant

officer

Again
the

colored
.
``
That
is
my
business

The
blood
rushed
to
the
temples
of
the
unknown
;
he
darted
at
poor
Cropole
,
the
descendant
of
<NUMBER>
of
the
officers
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
glance
that
would
have
crushed
him
down

if
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
nailed
to
the
spot
by
the
question
of
his
own
proper
interests
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
monsieur
,
you
do
not

I

From
that
it
results
that

makes

was

looked

therefore
,
at

,
as
much
as
to

,
``

With
this
change
he
made
up
a

Cropole
looked
at
the
diamond
so
long

that
the

hastily
:

said
the

replied
the

,
with
ineffable
majesty
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
profoundly
,
and
left
the
room
with
a
stupefied
air
,
which
announced
that
he
had
a
good
heart
,
and
felt
genuine
remorse
.
That
the
storm
had
passed
far
from
him
,
perhaps
he
had
prayed
in
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
``
Ah

``

``

deposited
a
tolerably
large
bag
as
directed

after
having
taken
from
it
the
amount
of

reckoning

The

asked
for
a

broke
off

bread
,
and
did
not

ate

repeated
a
noisy

eager
crowd
.
The
cortege
advanced
slowly
,
lighted
by
a
<NUMBER>
flambeaux
,
in
the
streets
and
from
the
windows
.
The
king
then
appeared
,
mounted
upon
a
splendid
horse
of

breed
,
with
a
flowing
mane
.
Some

the
courtiers

the
elder
ones

for

wore
traveling

;

all

were
clothed

The
noise

excited
him

:
for
a
moment
he
allowed
his
reason
to
be
absorbed
in
this
flood

lights

tumult

images

At
the
angle

the
street
there
remained
nothing
beneath
the

been

their
majesties
and
monsieur
le
cardinal
.
The
king
,
without
daring
to
call
upon
the
hospitality
of
his
uncle
,
had
waited
for
it
impatiently
.
For
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
already
puffed
up
with
the
great
event
which
had
taken
place
in
his
provincial
life
,
he
ate
nothing
whatever
.
had
a
prompt
and
bold
look
,
which
<UNK>
a
distinguished
<UNK>
of
beauty
.
This
word
was
the
name
of
a
woman
.
What
had
first
struck
the
king
was
a
certain
contrast
in
the
voices
of
the
<NUMBER>
interlocutors
.
An
abode
in
a
young
and
brilliant
court
would
<UNK>
them
a
little
.
''
``
Not
at
all
,
''
replied
the
cardinal
,
forcing
his
Italian
<UNK>
in
such
a
manner
that
,
from
soft
and
<UNK>
as
it
was
,
it
became
sharp
and
vibrating
,
``
not
at
all
:
I
have
a
full
and
fixed
intention
to
marry
them
,
and
that
as
well
as
I
shall
be
able
.
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
princess
,
presenting
to
his
majesty
a
fat
,
fair
girl
of
two-and-twenty
,
who
at
a
village
fete
might
have
been
taken
for
a
peasant
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
,
-
``
the
daughter
of
my
<UNK>
.
''
This
time
it
was
not
the
king
that
smiled
;
it
was
the
young
lady
presented
,
because
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
she
heard
,
given
to
her
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
generally
showed
no
<UNK>
to
spoil
her
,
such
an
honorable
<UNK>
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
nephew
?
''
``
Well
;
I
know
them
all
.
''
said
the
king
,
smiling
;
``
for
the
second
part
of
my
sentence
will
serve
as
a
<UNK>
to
the
first
.
``
Indeed
!
``
Now
,
look
,
aunt
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
drawing
still
nearer
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
under
the
pretext
of
gaining
a
better
point
of
view
,
``
look
at
that
simple
white
dress
by
the
side
of
those
<UNK>
specimens
of
<UNK>
,
and
those
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
my
dear
nephew
!
''
replied
the
king
with
a
look
of
doubt
.
The
young
girl
bowed
with
so
much
grace
,
mingled
with
the
profound
timidity
inspired
by
the
presence
of
the
king
,
that
the
latter
lost
,
while
looking
at
her
,
a
few
words
of
the
conversation
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
cardinal
.
Whether
the
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
a
pleasantry
,
or
uttered
in
all
<UNK>
,
they
proved
the
pitiless
<UNK>
of
everything
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
found
charming
or
poetic
in
the
young
girl
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
no
doubt
,
abused
the
beautiful
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
they
condescended
,
for
distraction
's
sake
,
to
speak
,
amidst
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
,
of
mortal
beauties
,
at
the
table
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
fortunately
,
as
we
have
said
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
ears
were
buzzing
,
and
her
eyes
veiled
by
timidity
,
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
;
and
the
king
,
who
had
still
his
attention
directed
to
the
conversation
of
the
cardinal
and
his
uncle
,
hastened
to
return
to
them
.
It
resulted
that
they
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
cardinal
,
on
turning
round
at
the
simple
noise
of
the
approaching
footsteps
of
his
majesty
,
saw
the
immediate
effect
of
them
upon
the
countenance
of
his
pupil
,
an
effect
betrayed
to
the
keen
eyes
of
his
eminence
by
a
slight
increase
of
color
.
He
with
his
eyes
interrogated
his
mother
more
than
<NUMBER>
times
:
but
she
,
given
up
to
the
pleasure
of
conversing
with
her
sister-in-law
,
and
likewise
constrained
by
the
glance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
did
not
appear
to
comprehend
any
of
the
supplications
conveyed
by
the
looks
of
her
son
.
This
officer
wore
his
gray
hat
with
its
long
red
plumes
upon
his
head
,
a
proof
that
he
was
called
there
by
his
duty
,
and
not
by
his
pleasure
.
Now
,
he
was
leaning
,
as
we
have
said
,
against
the
carved
<UNK>
when
the
melancholy
,
weary
eyes
of
the
king
,
by
chance
,
met
his
.
At
these
words
,
which
produced
the
effect
of
a
<UNK>
of
thunder
,
prevailing
over
the
orchestra
,
the
singing
and
the
buzz
of
the
<UNK>
,
the
cardinal
and
the
queen-mother
looked
at
each
other
with
surprise
.
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
king
;
``
I
am
fatigued
,
and
,
besides
,
wish
to
write
this
evening
.
''
At
the
extremity
of
this
hedge
stood
the
officer
,
impassible
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
.
The
domestics
walked
behind
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
given
his
orders
.
``
You
are
passing
now
,
sire
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
very
spot
where
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
the
first
stab
of
the
poniard
.
''
And
he
stopped
.
The
king
turned
towards
his
officer
,
and
saw
something
like
a
cloud
pass
over
his
martial
and
daring
countenance
.
But
the
king
,
who
appeared
to
wish
to
be
informed
,
was
disposed
to
give
another
look
at
this
dismal
spot
.
``
Why
does
the
floor
seem
hollowed
out
at
this
spot
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
march
was
resumed
promptly
,
for
emotion
,
no
doubt
,
had
given
to
the
voice
of
the
young
prince
a
tone
of
command
which
was
not
customary
with
him
.
Of
the
<NUMBER>
musketeers
who
had
accompanied
the
king
,
<NUMBER>
reconducted
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
<UNK>
,
which
were
not
yet
empty
,
notwithstanding
the
king
had
retired
.
This
officer
,
who
was
sleeping
,
or
preparing
to
sleep
,
was
,
notwithstanding
his
careless
air
,
charged
with
a
serious
responsibility
.
The
musketeers
there
mounted
guard
before
every
door
,
and
allowed
no
one
to
enter
,
except
the
couriers
,
who
,
even
while
he
was
traveling
,
followed
the
cardinal
for
the
carrying
on
of
his
correspondence
.
All
the
<UNK>
had
by
degrees
retired
.
had
been
able
to
learn
,
by
movement
much
more
distinguished
than
marked
his
own
leaving
,
the
departure
of
the
cardinal
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
sought
his
bedroom
,
accompanied
by
a
large
escort
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
Then
the
noise
of
steps
and
voices
became
lost
in
the
upper
floors
of
the
castle
.
But
he
was
stopped
short
by
a
presented
musket
and
the
cry
of
the
sentinel
.
The
soldier
called
<NUMBER>
of
his
eminence
's
officers
,
who
,
in
the
tone
in
which
a
youth
in
office

a
minister
,
let
fall
these
words
:
``
The

<UNK>
,
through
which
a
sentinel
glided
like
a
shadow
;
silence
,
which
permitted
him
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
,
accompanied
with
the
jingling
of
his
spurs
upon
the
stone
slabs
.
``
A
friend
,
''
replied
the
unknown
.
That
's
not
very
likely
.
''
``
Yes

''
``
Do

require

''
``

said
he
,
``

''
The
soldier
lowered
his
arms
,
overcome
by
the
dignity
with
which
these
words
were
pronounced
.
Yes
,
monsieur
.
''
The
unknown
saluted
the
soldier
in
a
lofty
fashion
,
and
ascended
the
staircase
;
whilst
a
cry
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
visit

''
asked
he
.
The
lieutenant
looked
attentively
at
the
unknown
,
and
in
that
look
,
however
rapid
,
he
saw
all
he
wished
to
see
-
that
is
to
say
,
a
person
of
high
distinction
in
an
ordinary
dress
.
The
king
has
retired
this
quarter
of
an

;
he
must
be
now

.
``

this

more
strongly
than

;
then

stretching
forth
his

to

his

clock
pointed

saw

heard

took

dismounting

walked

became
very

the

more

passionately

perhaps

He
would

The

mounted

set
out

whilst

Nothing
was

arranging

gave

himself

Monk
dwelt
upon
this

see
if

seize
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not

A

On

went

This

Not

Monk
concluded
there

seized

Monk
raised

Monk
turned

the

thrown

made
a

obedience

``
Ah

<PROPER_NOUN>
introduced
the

into

and
soon
large

yielded

rising
up
like

``

looking
round
him

He
then
struck

during
several

so
skillfully

sharply
upon

plaster

separated

<PROPER_NOUN>
grew
slightly
pale

an

crept
over

raised

the

rose
in

it
was
a

The

was
deserted

along
noiselessly

avoiding

When

he

The

attracted

then
was

as

a

to

he
said
to

as
he
looked
in

,
``

Then
,
passing

feeling

he
approached

appeared
a

But
at
the
moment
he
was
about
to
open

there
was
a
great
noise
in
the
gallery
,
the
ante-chamber
,
and
the
court
.
As
he
spoke
or
thought
thus
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the

Fouquet

appeared
before

regretted
so
deeply
not

dying
away
behind

Fouquet
perceived
this
movement
,
and
with
a
politeness
at
once
easy
and
respectful
,
advanced
towards
the
queen
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
king

Fouquet
perceived
that
the

instead

reading

was
looking
at
him
;
he
turned
half
round
,
therefore
,
and
while
continuing
his
conversation
with
the
queen

faced
the
king
.
``

The

looked
up
.
``

said
the
queen

''
``

said
the

politely

springs
the

he
glanced
upon

uttered
a

reading
the

``

in

put
on
a

all

wore

as
she
did

These

earnestly

An

recovering

colored

then
became

``

As
it
might
be
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in

afternoon
,
the

had
dined
:
supper
was
being
prepared
for
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
guests
.
But
,
against
all
probability
,
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
shutting
himself
up
that
Fouquet
shut
himself
up
thus
,
for
he
went
straight
to
a
bureau
,
seated
himself
at
it
,
opened
the
portfolio
,
and
began
to
make
a
choice
amongst
the
enormous
mass
of
papers
it
contained
.
Then
the
<UNK>
arose
with
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
and
walked
straight
up
to
a
glass
behind
which
the
blows
were
struck
by
a
hand
,
or
by
some
invisible
<UNK>
.
Without
doubt
,
these
reiterated
knocks
were
a
signal
;
for
,
at
the
moment
Fouquet
approached
the
glass
listening
,
the
same
noise
was
renewed
,
and
in
the
same
measure
.
I
did
not
expect
anybody
to-day
.
''
And
plunging
again
into
the
ocean
of
papers
unrolled
before
him
,
he
appeared
to
think
of
nothing
now
but
work
.
But
in
the
midst
of
his
ardent
labor
,
the
soft
strokes
upon
the
little
bell
placed
behind
the
glass
sounded
again
,
hasty
,
and
,
consequently
,
more
urgent
.
That
must
be
the
<UNK>
;
but
,
no
,
the
<UNK>
is
gone
to

for

The
greatest
certainty
is
,
that

do
not
know

that

know

He
then
applied
the
tip
of
his
finger
to
the
nail
parallel
to
the
one
he
had
drawn
.
The
walls
of
this
vault
were
covered
with

or
tiles
,
and
the
floor
with

As
soon
as
he
entered
,
he
examined
carefully
whether
the
glass
closed
without
leaving
any
trace
,
and
,
doubtless
satisfied
with
his
observation
,
he
opened
by
means
of
a
small
gold
key
the
triple
<UNK>
of
a
door
in

of

.
cried
the

,
starting
back
with
astonishment

enough

For

the

caught

his

concealed
so

were
all

escape
him

boiled
in
his
brain

conjectures

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a

,
with
that
imperturbable
phlegm
which
does
more
than
genius
for

he
put
off
reflection
till
the

,
for
fear

he
said
,
not

When

to

The

In

of

into

like

that
nothing

At

This

contained

He
himself

in

the

led

``

cried

the

``

That
which
astonished
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
coast
batteries
to
the
fortifications
of
the
city
,
was
to
see

of

had
often
heard
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

Besides

these

discouragement

``
Oh

that

turning

interrupted

``
Oh

<PROPER_NOUN>
picked
up
his
plan
,
folded
it
carefully
,
and
<UNK>
it
in
his
large
pocket
.
The
passage
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
made
rapidly
enough
,
thanks
to
<NUMBER>
of
those
little
corsairs
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
told
during
his
voyage
,
and
which
,
shaped
for
fast
sailing
and
destined
for

chase
,
were
sheltered
at
that
time
in
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
<NUMBER>
of
them
,
with
a
quarter
of
its
<UNK>
,
performed
duty
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<UNK>
.
So
if
he
had
found
nothing
,
our
cunning
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
rolling
and
<UNK>
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
was
because
,
in
truth
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
.
All
the
care
of
the
musketeer
was
then
,
for
the
moment
,
confined
to
the
watching
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
On
landing
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
inquired
if
his
horses
were
waiting
,
and
soon
perceived
them
at
the
crossing
of
the
road
that
winds
round
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
which
,
without
passing
through
that
little
city
,
leads
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
simply
told
the
equerry
to
dismount
and
await
his
return
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whilst
D'Artagnan
would
ride
his
horse
;
which
was
arranged
.
I
have
not
my
<UNK>
here
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
placed
his

at

''
``
He

<PROPER_NOUN>

The

when

is
able

put
a

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

``
No

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
you

They
entered
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
faubourg
;
but
scarcely
had
they
gone
a
<NUMBER>
paces
when
they
were
surprised
to
find
the
streets
strewed
with
leaves
and
flowers
.
The
blinds
were
closed
,
and
the
breeze
penetrated
into
the
houses
under
the
hangings
,
which
cast
long
,
black
shades
between
their
places
of
issue
and
the
walls
.
Then
,
beneath
these
crosses
and
banners
,
as

protected
by
them
,
walked
a
whole
world
of
young

clothed
in
white
,
crowned
with
<UNK>
.
A
<UNK>
with
a
<UNK>
voice
-
a
man
certainly
picked
out
from
all
the
voices
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
was
the
<UNK>
of
the
imperial
guard
from
all
the

escorted
by
<NUMBER>
other
<UNK>
,
who
appeared
to
be
there
only
to
serve
him
as
an
accompaniment
,
made
the
air
resound
,
and
the
windows
of
the
houses
vibrate
.
cried
the
musketeer
,
involuntarily
,
as
this
lofty
countenance
passed
before
him
.
On
his
part
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
thanks
to
the
<UNK>
of
his
sight
,
had
seen
all
,
seized
all
.
It
was
evident
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
asked
himself
this
question
:
-
``
Why
is
D'Artagnan
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
what
does
he
want
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
?

Therefore
,
to
put
an
end
to
his

of
an
<UNK>

it

necessary

as

at
any

,
a

a

which
annoys
him
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
stretched
forth
his
beautiful
white
hand
,
upon
which
sparkled
the
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
ring
;
he
cut
the
air
with
sign
of
the
cross
,
and
poured
out
his
benediction
upon
his
<NUMBER>
friends
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
only
touched
the

,
and
he
turned
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
almost
angry

Decidedly
,
he
is
a

a
brave
man

''
``
That
is
true

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
aloud
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
remarked
that
this
crowd
was
composed
principally
of
citizens
and
military
men
.
Women
,
children
,
and
old
men
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
cortege
of
ordinary
<UNK>
,
was
not
the

for
him

He
then
re-entered
his
palace
;
the
doors
closed
slowly
,
and
the
crowd
melted
away
,
whilst
<UNK>
and
prayers
were
still
resounding
abroad
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
something
like
the
presence
of
an
invisible
hand
which
had

<UNK>
,
created
this
strength
,
this
joy

this
happiness

and
spread
everywhere
these

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
entered
the
bishop
's
residence
by
a
private
door
,
as
his
personal
friends
.
And
yet
this
reserve
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
prevent
his
asking
questions
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
carried
his
head
high
,
like
a
man
accustomed
to
command
:
his
violet
robe
was
<UNK>
up
on
<NUMBER>
side
,
and
his
white
hand
was
on
his
hip
.
It
no

intoxicated

it
penetrated

inspired
desire

it

respect

<UNK>
by

was
cautious

only
presented
flesh
to

,
and
not

against
gold

He
felt
himself
caught

,
precisely
,
because

caught
he
felt
himself
on

it

said
he
,

without

``
In

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked

suspiciously

As

it
was
not

manifested
for

;
it

it

He
allowed

his

to
stray
upon

-
like
the
sword
which
yields
to
too
powerful
a

You
may
understand
why

both
began

the

by

At
midnight
he
<UNK>
up

they
sent

at

And
he
embraced

D'Artagnan
extinguished
his

who

the

traversed

on

went
to

room

The
door

the
chamber
opened
softly
under
the
delicate
pressure
of
the
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
voice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
soft

kind

it
conveyed
more

it
conveyed
an

And

he
let
fall
a

from

escaped

At

The

<UNK>
between

observing

Raoul
observed
its
effect
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
trembled
with
anger
from
head
to
foot
,
and
leaned
against
<NUMBER>
of
the
poles
of
the

prevent
himself
falling

his
eyes
became
suffused
with
blood

and
the
hand
which
he
did
not

support
wandered
towards
the
hilt
of
his

This

misfortune

who
fancied

perceived

The
admiral
,
however
,
without
taking
any

notice
of

ill-humor
,
led
the

into

The

finished

<PROPER_NOUN>
darted
forward

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
from

this

it

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

turn

give

a
lesson

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
loved

comprehended
it
all

The
admiral
,
as

was
determined

pay
no

attention
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

threatening
glances

fits

<UNK>
had
been
everywhere
restored

except

heart
;
he
,
in
his
impatience

addressed
himself
to
the
princess

in
a
low
tone
of
voice
:
``
For

madame

hasten

He
understood
everything

and
trembled
as
he
reflected
on
the
position
of
affairs
,
and
the
state
of
the
minds
of
those
about

The
barge
was
carpeted
with
velvet

decorated
with
<UNK>
embroidered
with
the
arms

and
with

of

at

<UNK>
was

forgotten
in
these

I

your

be
good
enough

precede

ashore

give
directions

The
order

was
explicit
;

the
admiral
,
who
heard
it
given

immediately
called
out
,
``

The
queen-mother
rose

tone

``
I

On

arrival
he
was
in
such
a

apathy

not
been
received
at
the
harbor

had
directed

Great
numbers
of
the
inhabitants
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
having
embarked
in
<UNK>
and
boats
of
every
description

set
off
to
meet
the
royal
barge

During
the
time
she
was
passing
through

<UNK>
beneath

the

upon

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
escaping

English
friends

hurried
through
the
town

hastened
rapidly
towards
the
place
intended
for
the
residence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
first
thing
which
struck
them
was
the
number

people
assembled
in

square

It
had
a
singularly
curious
effect

almost
<UNK>
in
its
appearance

He
pushed
hastily
through
the
crowd
of
curious
<UNK>
,
and
,
at
the
sight
of
these
unexpected

uttered
a
cry

anger

dismay

Of

<NUMBER>
guardians

only

said

in
a

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

leaning
on
the
arm

as

with

``
My

replied
the

in

a
warning

from

restrained
him

affectionate
reception
.
The
count
had
thrown
himself
back
on
his
seat
,
leaning
his
shoulders
against
the
partition
of
the
tent
,
and
remained
thus
,
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
,
with
heaving
chest
and
restless
limbs
.
``
<UNK>
,
I
suppose
?
''
``
Shall
I
leave
you
?
''
``
You
will
be
frank
with

''
``
Because

is
in

is
it
not

''
``
You
are

``
Do
you
not

``

''
``
Listen
to
me
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
we
have
been
<UNK>
together
;
we
have
been
on
horseback
for
<NUMBER>
hours
at
a
time
,
and
our

dying
from

,
or
hunger

have
fallen
beneath

yet
we
have
laughed
at

``
That
of

''
``
No

still
he
is
<UNK>

You
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
,
what
did
you
say
to
him
?
The
noble
character
of
the
young
man
's
countenance
expressed
a
displeasure
which
could
easily
be
read
.
``
You
spoke
to
him
in
that

''
These
words
were
so
<UNK>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
turned
pale
,
and
,
overcome
by
a
sudden
agitation
,
was
barely
able
to
stretch
out
<NUMBER>
hand
mechanically
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
covered
his
eyes
and
face
with
the
other
.
It
is
thus
that
we
act

your
Grace
;
it
is
thus
that
every

honor
ought

act

But
now

I
entreat
you

leave
me
to
myself

``
I
leave
you
,
then
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
withdrew
.
A
few
<UNK>
clouds
were
floating
in
the
heavens
,
and
indicated
from
their
appearance
a
<UNK>
of
beautiful
weather
,
tempered
by
a
gentle
breeze
from
the
east
.
<UNK>
behind
the
thick
curtains
of
his
own
tent
,
embracing
with
a
glance
the
whole
square
,
he
noticed
that
,
after
a
few
moments
'
pause
,
the
curtains
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
tent
were
agitated
,
and
then
drawn
partially
aside
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
concealed
in
the
shadow
,
divined
the
many
passionate
thoughts
that
established
,
between
the
tent
of
the
young
ambassador
and
the
balcony
of
the
princess
,
a
mysterious
and
magical
bond
of
sympathy
-
a
bond
created
by
thoughts
imprinted
with
so
much
strength
and
persistence
of
will
,
that
they
must
have
caused
happy
and
loving
dreams
to
alight
upon
the
perfumed
couch
,
which
the
count
,
with
the
eyes
of
his
soul
,
devoured
so
eagerly
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
resist
smiling
,
as
thinking
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
said
to
himself
,
``
<UNK>
is
,
indeed
,
a
heart
well
besieged

''
and
then
added
,
<UNK>
,
as
he
thought
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
he
is
a

''
The
next
day
the
fetes
took
place
,
accompanied
by
all
the
pomp
and
animation
that
the
resources
of
the
town
and
the
cheerful
disposition

minds
could
supply

As
soon
as
it
had
been
settled
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
accompany
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
young
duke
selected
a
corps
of
gentlemen
and
officers
to
form
part
of
his
own
suite
,
so
that
it
was
almost
an
army
that
now
set
out
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
gold
,
and
exciting
the
liveliest
demonstrations
as
they
passed
through
the
different
towns

on
the
route

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
its
vast
variety
of
vegetation

its
blue
skies

silver
rivers
,
displayed
itself
in
all
the
<UNK>
of
a
paradise
to
the
new
sister
of
the
king
.
the
poor
duke
could
perceive
that
the
image
of
that
country
so
cherished
by
himself
became
,
from
day
to
day
,
more
and
more
effaced
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mind
,
in
exact
proportion
as
her
affection
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
became
more
deeply
engraved
on
her
heart
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
himself
a
prey
to
all
the
tortures
of
jealousy
;
an
unknown
,
unheard
of
anguish
glided
through
his
veins
,
and
laid
siege
to
his
heart
;
and
then
,
as
if
to
show
that
he
knew
the
folly
of
his
conduct
,
and
that
he
wished
to
correct

by
the

his

he
mastered
his

with

with
foam
,
to
<UNK>
his

close
beside
the
carriage
,
amidst
the
crowd
of
courtiers
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
patiently
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
remarks
,
for
he
instinctively
felt
,
without
having
had
any
proof
that
such
was
the
case
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
checked
the
display

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
and
that

had
it
not

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
some
mad
act

proceeding
,
either
of
the
count

or
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
,
would
have
brought
about
an
open
rupture

perhaps
even
exile
itself

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
that

he

immediately
remarked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

divined
the

suddenly
stepping

the

into

which

even
in

gave
a

said
;

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

it

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
drew

gracefully
from

saluted

put

reserved
this

he
clasped
his

firmly
in

awaited
the
encounter

It
matters
little

however

It
is
a
subject
of
remark

that
<UNK>
and
restless
characters
invariably
seek
the
companionship

gentle

dispositions

as
if
the

sought

in
the
contrast

a
repose

the

a
protection

find
gratification
in
an
excess

also

danger
has
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
only
person
who
divined
the
power

this

attraction
,
and
as
his
heart
was
already
engaged

he
arrived
in
the
capital
full
of
indifference

distrust

It
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself

followed
by

by

followed
by
a

After
the

had
been
rendered

the
ceremony
completed

the

slowly
resumed

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
arrived
,
seeing
how
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
pressed
by
his
dangerous
questioner

to

addressed
a

in

changed
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
once

returned

however

Between

a

a

After
he
had
fulfilled
this

Raoul
approached

,
as

At

the

passed
onward

his

But
the

mounted

advanced
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
stopping
for
a
moment
at
the
table
where
the

playing
together

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
made
a
movement
of
the
head
,
which
seemed
to
signify
,
``

is

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
holding
both
his
hands
toward
the
duke
,
and
leading
him
behind
a
column
.
``
There
is
certainly
no

bear

``
Because

with

took
the

abandoned

His

immediately
faded
away
,

his

became
cold

sharp
as

manifested
no

The

The

stopped

The

Fouquet
appeared

The

fertile

sharpened

noble

traced

From

Others

secret
passage
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
her
practice
to
pass
hours
either
in
her
oratory
or
in
her
room
,
without
either
reading
or
praying
.
``
The
prime
minister
,
''
she
said
,
``
is
obliged
in
these
<UNK>
days
to
inform
the
queen

all
that
is
happening
from
time
to

without
exciting
the
curiosity
or
remarks
of
the
court

``
I
do
not
remember
what
he
did
,
but
I
have
inquired
and
I
have
been
told
all
about
it

''
At
this
very
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
.
He
bowed
respectfully
to
the
king
,
who
gave
him
a
somewhat
cavalier
reception
,
but
a
look
from
his
mother
<UNK>
him
for
the
hatred
which

from
his
infancy

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
queen
had
several
times
already
told
her
son
that
he
ought
to
go
to
bed
,
and
several
times
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
<UNK>
insisted
on
staying
where
he
was
;
but
now
he
made
no
reply
,
but
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lips
with
anger
.
``
I
thought
you
were
angry
with
me
,
madame
;
you
sent
me
away

interposed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
order
to
turn
the
subject
,
``
to
whom
does
your
majesty
wish
me
to
give
the
candle
?
''
``
Good
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
am
glad
to
see
that
his
majesty
has
been
brought
up
with
a
hatred
of
dissimulation
.
''
Besides
,
his
majesty
takes
no
pains
to
conceal
how
little
affection
he
has
for
me
.
``
But
,
''
continued
the
queen
,
``
you
have
doubtless
come
for
some
important
purpose
.
``
Why
,
''
cried
the
queen
;
``
how
is
that
?
''
``
Alas
!
Now
as
you
are
<NUMBER>
of
the
whole

I
mean
to
say

rather
at
what
he
said
?

``
What

You

``
Yes

Ah

smiling

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
the
coffer
;
a

covered

with

dignity

extending
toward

still
beautiful

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
notwithstanding
this
permission

instead

reading

took
the
knife
which
the

snatched
out

sent

she

with

ghastly
smile

The
other
was
that
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of

,
warning
him
that
he
was
about
to

assassinated

that
communication
had
arrived
too
late

``
It
appears

she
resumed
,
``
that

sold
it

indefinable

passed
over

Scarcely
had
he
left
her
when
the
queen
went
into
her
son

room
,
and
inquired
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
if
the

When
he
was
alone
he
opened

that

``
Here

he

D'Artagnan
admired

And
he
searched
the
cabinet
even
to
the

recesses

there
was
no

There
was
a

in
the

which
vanished
immediately

he
knew
nothing

purpose

It

true
I
fought
with
tolerable
success

resumed
<PROPER_NOUN>

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
surprised

thought
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
is
this
a

not

``

told

I
remember
too
well
how
sometimes
we
were
stopped
for

money
,

for

which
I
was

said

do
things
cheaply

``
You

``
I

''
``
Well
,
then
,
all
is
settled
;
you
are
to
set
off

said
the
cardinal
.
``

he
said

the

laughing

I

thou

a
<NUMBER>

We
will
explain
in
a
few
words
how
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
led
to
choose
that
place
of
residence
.
So
long
as
he
was
surrounded
by
his
friends
he
retained
his
youth
and
the
poetry
of
his
character
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
first
to
leave
him
,
in
order
that
he
might
retire
to
a
little
property
he
had
inherited
near
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
second
,
to
marry
an
attorney
's
wife
;
and
lastly
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
third
,
to
take
orders
and
become
an
abbe
.
A
garrison
life
is
fatal
even
to
the
most
aristocratic
organization
;
and
imperceptibly
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
always
in
the
camp
,
always
on
horseback
,
always
in
garrison
,
became
-LRB-
I
know
not
how
in
the
present
age
<NUMBER>
would
express
it
-RRB-
a
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
He
was
thought
to
be
dead
;
his
wife
,
especially
,
who
cherished
the
pleasing
idea
that
she
was
a
widow
,
stoutly
maintained
that
death
had
taken
him
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
my
dear
!
``
All
right
;
if
he
comes
back
you
will
kill
him
,
you
are
so
skillful
and
so
brave
.
''
``
So
you
refuse
my
request
?
''
Then
along
toward
the
fourth
year
came
the
expedition
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
to
that
,
we
know
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
courage
;
he
exposed
himself
freely
to
danger
and
while
charging
at
the
head
of
his
company
he
received
a
ball
through
the
chest
which
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
field
of
battle
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
a
man
to
let
himself
be
killed
like
that
.
Once
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
turned
his
course
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
reaching
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
straight
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
need
not
be
said
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
still
thinking
of
the
husband
.
``
With
monsieur
.
''
I
must
stay
and
follow
the
advice
of
my
hostess
,
while
<UNK>
the
conjugal
designs
of
this
<UNK>
apparition
.
''
D'Artagnan
looked
out
and
at
the
corner
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
hostess
coming
along
hanging
to
the
arm
of
an
enormous
Swiss
,
who
<UNK>
in
his
walk
with
a
magnificent
air
which
pleasantly
reminded
him
of
his
old
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
oh
!
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
,
looked
at
the
hostess
,
who
turned
pale
.
``
Is
monsieur
your
cousin
?
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
replied
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
Swiss
became
as
purple
as
a
<UNK>
.
``
I
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
sudden
<UNK>
of
wrath
,
seized
the
lad
by
the
ear
and
led
him
apart
,
with
the
injunction
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
you
where
you
are
and
do
n't
you
stir
,
or
I
will
pull
this
ear
off

he
said
.
Come
then
,
and
take
a
turn
with
me
and
I
will
explain
.
''
said
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
needed
a
little
time
to
take
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
proposal
,
``
<UNK>
!
It
was
night
when
the
<NUMBER>
adversaries
reached
the
field
of
battle
.
With
these
words
he
drew
in
his
turn
and
crossed
swords
with
his
adversary
.
said
:
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
what
did
I
tell
you
?
Oh

by
the

take
lodging
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
at

The
boy
found
him
sitting
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
him
,
still
overwhelmed
by
the
coolness
of
his
adversary
.
So
much
the
worse
for
you
,
for
by
such
conduct
you
have
lost
my
esteem
and
my
patronage

Have
my
valise
carried
to
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

What
more
need
be
said
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
returned
home
in
thoughtful
mood
,
finding
a
somewhat
lively
pleasure
in
carrying
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
bag
of
money
and
thinking
of
that
fine
diamond
which
he
had
once
called
his
own
and
which
he
had
seen
on
the
minister
's
finger
that
night
.
that
would
be
a
far
better
life
than
I
lead
now
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
a
mean
wretch
,
who
wo
n't
<UNK>
himself
of
his
diamond
in
my
favor
.
''
On
approaching
the
hotel
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
found
,
however
,
that
it
was
in
front
of
the
next
house
the
mob
was
collected
.
He
was
told
that
<NUMBER>
citizens
,
headed
by
<NUMBER>
man
,
had
attacked
a
carriage
which
was
escorted
by
a
troop
of
the
cardinal
's
<UNK>
;
but
a
reinforcement
having
come
up
,
the
assailants
had
been
put
to
flight
and
the
leader
had
taken
refuge
in
the
hotel
next
to
his
lodgings
;
the
house
was
now
being
searched
.
He
had
been
contented
,
for
the
convenience
of
the
house
,
to
lodge
in
the
fourth
story
;
and
truth
<UNK>
us
even
to
confess
that
his
chamber
was
just
above
the
<UNK>
and
below
the
roof
.
He
was
hungry
;
he
supped
,
he
went
to
bed
.
At
daybreak
he
awoke
and
took
a
turn
around
his
room
.
Oh
!
I
was
just
reading
the
name
of
the
place
when
the
wind
blew
my
letter
away
,
I
suppose
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
there
's
no
use
in
thinking
any
more
about
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
I
had
left
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
it
arrived
and
I
never
received
it
until
the
month
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
;
and
as
the
invitation
was
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
,
I
could
n't
accept
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
eagerly
searched
for
the
<UNK>
of
this
letter
;
it
was
dated
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
must
have
become
an
idiot
by
this
time
from
drinking
.
``
In
his
convent
!
if
I
were

learned

I
should
recollect

Yes

yes

now
what
did
I
do
with
that
letter

As
I
am

read

bent
low

with

mingled

retired
in

saddle

he
read

The

were
as

:

started

he

for
thinking

His

of
perfect

made

uneasy
.

beginning

And
he
wrote
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
hasten
his
return

The
duke
was
the

It
is
understood

that
when

He
drew

of
the
cardinal
;
and
as
his
talents
did
not
enable
him
to
produce
a
very
good

,
he
wrote
under
the
picture
that
there
might
be
little
doubt
regarding
the
original
:
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

not

To

de

replied
that
since
every
opportunity

distinguishing

in

taken
from

With

he
was

<UNK>
,
as

The

was
received
with
loud
applause
.
The

performed
<NUMBER>
evolutions

laid

who
at

seemed

succeeded
,
and
he
bit
his

with
vexation

The
dog
again
shook
his
head
as
if
to
say
``
no

''
``
Gentlemen
,
you
see

''
said
the
duke
to
those

,
who
dared
not
even
smile
,
``

The

sprang
,
and
in

of
the
height
jumped
lightly
over
it

The

turned
his

to

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
at
first
,
turned
round
on

stood
with

Then
the

said
openly

came
into
the
room

hardly
<UNK>
for
the
loss
of
that
which

had
experienced

He
accepted

``

answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
he
went
right
to

As
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
he
saw
this

on

he
took

up

made

A
fresh

joke
now
occurred
to
the

course

his
morning

walk
he
collected

<NUMBER>
small
branches
from

and
found
a

piece
of
broken

a

that
quite
delighted

When
everything
was
ready
,
the
gallows
hung
in

middle

the
<UNK>
made
,
and
when

had
cast
a
glance
upon

in

select

he
looked
around
for
his
piece
of
glass
;
it
had
disappeared

``
What

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

Then
he
placed
the
gibbet
in

middle
of
the
room

bursting
with
laughter

the

laughing
violently

said

put
it
in
his
pocket

The
prisoner
happened
to
remark
among

he
favored

the

``

cried
the

he
felt

arms
on

shoulders
like

iron
claws
;
but
instead
either
of
calling

defending

he
placed
his

on
his
lips

said
in
a
low
tone
:
``
Hush

The
duke
,
more
and
more
bewildered

let
<PROPER_NOUN>
loose
and
took
the
note

The
duke
tore
open
the
note
,
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
for
he
was
dazzled
and
confused
,
and
read
:

became
perfectly
giddy

The

evinced
the

of
the

taken
at

that

Therefore

looked
at

with
an
expression

``
Very

if
ever
you
meet

again

on

in

in

anywhere

crush

When
once
in
the
saddle
<PROPER_NOUN>
reflected
on
<NUMBER>
things
;
first
,
that
at
the
pace
he
was
going
his
horse
would
not
carry
him
<NUMBER>
miles
,
and
secondly
,
that
he
had
no
money
.
That
cry
was
of
such
importance
as
to
overcome
all
preoccupation
.
There
was
therefore
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
follow
the
prudent
advice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
beat
a
retreat
.
As
a
further
precaution
they
had
bound
his
hands
.
He
questioned
them
as
to
the
news
they
had
each
been
charged
to
obtain
,
but
nothing
positive
had
been
learned
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
permission
from
the

by
a
glance
and
went
out
.
Every
<NUMBER>
stood
up

eagerly
replied
the
prince
,
``
will
I
permit

The

now
is
to
learn
where

what

Meanwhile
<PROPER_NOUN>
closely
observed
the
young
general
,
already
made
so
famous
by
the
battles
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
enemy
was
marching
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
the
intention
,
doubtless
,
of
securing
possession
of
that
town
and
separating
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
army
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

To
this
question
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
respond

``
Certainly

he
said

<UNK>
his

<UNK>
tones
,
as
if
he
were
speaking
to

``
Yes

Meanwhile
the
prince
took
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
aside
and
asked
him
how
the
prisoner
had
been
taken
and
who
this
young
man
was
.
``
Very
well

said
the
prince
;
``
give
it
to
me

The

looked
at
him
with
unspeakable
distrust

``
Ah

my

indifferently

``
Ah

replied
the

``
He
says
he
is
German

my

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
I
doubt
it

``
Well
enough
to
question
him
in

The
prisoner
did
not
understand
,
or
seemed
not
to
understand

what
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
to
him
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
hardly
understand
his

containing
a
mixture
of

and

.
``
Ah

that

''
said
the

,
``
I
understand

since

Italian
I
will
myself
continue
the
examination

``
Very
good

''
said
the
prince
,
understanding
the
reason
of
that

;
``
the

caught

When

reached

the

stopped

Then
turning
toward
the

,
``
Take

he
said

keep

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
n't
wait
to
be

twice

knew
that
with
superiors

especially
when
those

are
princes

the
highest
politeness
is
to
obey
without

went
to
rejoin

at

mounted

The

threw

over

as

do
when

started
at

and
his

,
whilst
messengers
sent
to
recall
the

set
out
with
a
loose
rein
in
other
directions
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
.
From
time
to

his
nostrils
dilated
as

eager
for
the
smell
of
powder
,
and
he
<UNK>
like
a

The

had
already
fled
,
taking
refuge
in

;
only
a

remained

``

said

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

For

they
proceeded
thus
,
the
cannon-shot
sounding
so
near
that
they
expected
at

to
hear
the

In

they
reached
the

;
those
ruins
crowned
the
summit

which
overlooked
the
surrounding

He
took
a

,
tore
a

from

and
wrote

Then

turning
toward

:

put

took

leaving
the

As

had
foreseen

had
fallen

immediately

At

o'clock
the
night
had
fully
come

The

assigned

his

The
order

battle
on

was
to
be
that

positions
taken
in
the
evening

<NUMBER>
things
were
especially
urged
upon
the
officers
,
who
were
to
see
that
the
soldiers
observed
them
scrupulously
:
the
first
,
that
the
different

should
so
march
that
cavalry

infantry
should
be
on

and
that

the

to
go
to

no

to
let

fire
first

And
besides
,
even
for
old
soldiers
the
evening
before
a
battle
is
a
serious
time
;
it
was
so
with
greater
reason
to
<NUMBER>
young

who
were
about
to
witness
for
the
first

that

spectacle

The
letters
were
long
-
the
<NUMBER>
pages
were
covered
with
closely
written
words
.
``
In
case
I
should
be
killed

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
For
different
reasons
this
was
an
agreeable
proposition
to
them
all
,
and
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
each
should
leave
a
very
exact
address
and
that
upon
the
request

a

should

eating
house
in

of

They
were

by

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
astonished
.
In

very
few
minutes
the
<NUMBER>
bottles
were
empty
and
this
excellent
<UNK>
succeeded
in
<UNK>
even
the
slightest
cloud
that
might
have
rested
on
their
spirits
.
``
Faith

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
laughing
,
``
we
have
praised

In

there

do
?

At

their
hilarity
calmed
down
and
:
``
Faith

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
By
me

and
this
morning
he
sent
for

ask

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

a
broad
smile
spreading
over
his
honest
face

``

The

shook
her

despairingly

I
heard
that

the

the

her

Although
the

was
often
tormented
by

he
was
more

Just

colored

his

seemed
dyed
by

became
livid

At

perceived

The

burst
into

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
around

the

Such

His

At

ran

the

was
the

the

gravely

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing

amused

The

The

into

separated
from
the

the

a

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
stretching
out
his
hand
to
assure
himself
whether
a
chill
sensation
he
felt
on
his
cheek
was
not
really
caused
by
a
drop
of
rain
.
``
Well

<PROPER_NOUN>

my

you
seen
anything

``
Those

``
I

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

''
As
our
fugitives
approached
the
house
,
they
found
the
ground
cut
up
,
as
if
a
considerable
body
of
horsemen
had
preceded
them
.
``
The

He
dismounted
and
knocked
on

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

It
was
evident
that
he
had
attempted
to
regain
his

had
not
had
sufficient
strength
to
do
so

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
some
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
threw
it
upon
his
face
.
Again
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
in
astonishment
at
these

appeared

him

asked

in
the

asked
the
wounded

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
remembered
that
this
was
the
name
by
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
called
the
man
they
had
found
in
the
passage
of
the
king

tent
.
They
brought
him
into
this
room
and
placed
sentinels
at
the
doors
and
windows
.
I
went
out
as
if
to
fetch
wood
,
passed
through
the
subterranean
passage
into
the
cellar
,
and
whilst
Parry
was
gently
<UNK>
the
door
,
pushed
up
the
board
and
beckoned
to
the
king
to
follow
me
.
I
went
on
first
,
fortunately
.
I
dragged
myself
as
far
as
the
yard
.
``
Very
ill

''
replied
the
wounded
man
.
``
Have
you
any

``
Alas

they

``
Faith

In
the

the
fugitives
had
returned
to

where
they
took
counsel
together
.
``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

Porthos
shall
show
him
how

knock
down
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
the
fist
,
and
I
how
to
trip
up
a
bull
by
taking
him
by
the
horns
.
This
was
,
as
we
have
seen
,
the
term
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
applied
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
his

.

It
turned
out
as

had
foreseen

In

the

a

table
was
placed
for

a

Let

manage

The
table
at
which
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
officers
were
seated
was
round
,
and
whether
by
chance

intention
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
sat
with
his

to
the

``
I

bowing

<PROPER_NOUN>

The

sent

across

Next

led

gave

The

wearing

Notwithstanding

the

listened

seized

The

was
indescribable

<UNK>
was
at

restored

And
shrugging
his

contempt
he
passed
on

turned
quickly
around

with
tears

,
``

grasped

The

The

started
out

,
leaning

was
gazing
at

he

waiting
first
for

then
for

He

constrained

admit

awake

that

was
real

But
I
shall
have
a

A
neighboring
church
clock
slowly
struck
the
hour
.
He
buried
his
brow
in
his
hands
and
thought
of
the

so
beautiful
when

about

waved

The

looked

shook
his

At
this

a

like

beneath

He

in

wrapped

sprang
up

handed
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
the

in

trembling

read

He
turned
up
his

neatly
and
rubbed
the

on
the
floor
,

did
not
fail

however

to
remark
that

was
looking
about

in

He
made
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
parried

his

a

D'Artagnan
resumed

the
