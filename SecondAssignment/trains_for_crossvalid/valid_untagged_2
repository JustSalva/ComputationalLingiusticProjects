This
new

,
quite
ready
to
appear
on
the
political
stage
,
and
to
measure
himself
against

however
gigantic
the

<UNK>
his
country
better

he
did
his

the

had
,
by
the
Perpetual

,
extinguished
the
hope
which
the
young
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
have
entertained
of
<NUMBER>
day
becoming
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
a
real
miracle
that
on
that
day
he
escaped
from
the
doom
intended
for
him
.
The
life
of
the
<NUMBER>
brothers
being
a
constant
obstacle
to
their
plans
,
they
changed
their
tactics
,
and
tried
to
obtain
by
calumny
what
they
had
not
been
able
to
effect
by
the
aid
of
the
poniard
.
He
lodged
an
information
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
setting
forth
that
the
<UNK>
-
who
,
as
he
had
shown
by

added

,
was
<UNK>
at
the
<UNK>
of
the
Perpetual

had
,
from
hatred
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
hired
an
assassin
to
deliver
the
new
<UNK>
of
its
new
Stadtholder
;
and
he
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
person
thus
chosen
;
but
that
,
horrified
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
act
which
he
was
asked
to
<UNK>
,
he
had
preferred
rather
to
reveal
the
crime
than
to
commit
it
.
He
belonged
to
that
race
of
martyrs
who
,
<UNK>
<UNK>
to
their
political
<UNK>
as
their
ancestors
were
to
their
faith
,
are
able
to
smile
on
pain
:
while
being
stretched
on
the
rack
,
he
recited
with
a
firm
voice
,
and
scanning
the
lines
according
to
measure
,
the
first
<UNK>
of
the
``
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
''
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
,
making
no
confession
,
tired
not
only
the
strength
,
but
even
the
fanaticism
,
of
his
executioners
.
They
,
at
least
in
the
case
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
contented
themselves
with
<UNK>
him
.
Thus
,
then
,
on
the
20th
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
,
as
we
have
already
stated
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
,
the
whole
town
was
crowding
towards
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
witness
the
departure
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
prison
,
as
he
was
going
to
exile
;
and
to
see
what
traces
the
torture
of
the
rack
had
left
on
the
noble
frame
of
the
man
who
knew
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
so
well
.
``
Has
not

''
they
would
say
,
``

locked
up
and
broken
by

``
Besides
which
,
''
the
fierce
enemies
of

chimed
in
,
``

the
work

done
well
and
bravely

of
a

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
gold
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
And
every
<UNK>
of
his
speech
,
eagerly
listened
to
by
the
populace
,
called
forth
enthusiastic
cheers
for
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
groans
and
imprecations
of
blind
fury
against
the

seen
her
.
''
``
And
let
us
not
forget
,
''
a
voice
exclaimed
from
the
crowd
,
``

at
the

``
Forward

to

''
The
men
on
their
horses
,
indeed
,
stood
like
so
many
statues
,
under
the
eye
of
their
chief
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
captain
of
the
mounted
troops
of

who
had
his

drawn
,
but
held
it
with
its
point
downwards
,
in
a
line
with
the
<UNK>
of
his
stirrup
.
In
this
moment
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
rode
forth
towards
them
<UNK>
,
merely
lifting
his
sword
and
<UNK>
his
brow
whilst
he
addressed
them
:
-
``

But

as

to
death
in
good

,
I
am
here
to
prevent
that

and
I
shall

he
exclaimed
,
with
that
bantering

which
is
peculiar
to
men

;
``

``
Death

With
this
,
he
took
his
post
at
the
head
of
his

,
whilst
the
tumult
grew
<UNK>
and

about
the

admitted

the

replied

was

did
their

Why

reached

The

He
considered
a

at

his

were
crowned
with
success

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
eager

ascertain
the

that
he
remained
at

All

he
perceived

earth
on

only
the

This
was
enough
to
console
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
enough
to
fan
the
rage

<PROPER_NOUN>
heard

saw

he
deemed

lucky
in

and
,
being
more
than

incensed
against

he
resolved

his

Some

caught
at
the
idea
without
believing

but
such
is
the
power

imagination
among
<UNK>

Sometimes

whilst

he
<UNK>
himself
into

with

the

admitted
only
the

who

and
who
from
the

ventured
no

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

took

not

He

when
the

gathering

and
which

being

would

the

will
be
soothed
down

he

some

put

the

The

broke
the

tore
off

cast
an
eager

on

met

he

But
he
had
murdered
his

with
a
double

the

the

He
then
climbed
into
his
sycamore

All
was
perfectly
quiet

not

the

<NUMBER>

In

On

the

empty

the
wrath

ran
very

fallen

Why

About

a

When

received

on

looking

That
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
,
-
``
Let

be
as
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
The
only
point
about
which
there
seemed
any
difficulty
was
whether
this
correspondence
had
been
intrusted
to
him
by
his
godfather
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
described
his
indifference
to
politics
,
his
love
of
study
,
of
the
fine
arts
,
of
science
,
and
of
flowers
.
To
this
again
it
was
objected
,
that
his
pretended
indifference
respecting
this
deposit
was
not
to
be
reasonably
entertained
,
as
he
could
not
have
received
such
papers
from
the
hand
of
his
godfather
without
being
made
acquainted
with
their
important
character
.
As
to
a
letter
,
he
certainly
had
some
remembrance
that
some
moments
previous
to
his
arrest
,
whilst
he
was
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
<NUMBER>
of
the
rarest
of
his
bulbs
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
servant
entered
his
dry-room
,
and
handed
to
him
a
paper
,
but
the
whole
was
to
him
only
like
a
vague
dream
;
the
servant
had
disappeared
,
and
as
to
the
paper
,
perhaps
it
might
be
found
if
a
proper
search
were
made
.
The
judges
wished
to
make
it
appear
as
though
they
wanted
to
urge
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
make
a
better
defence
;
they
displayed
that
benevolent
patience
which
is
generally
a
sign
of
the
magistrate
's
being
interested
for
the
prisoner
,
or
of
a
man
's
having
so
completely
got
the
better
of
his
adversary
that
he
needs
no
longer
any
<UNK>
means
to
ruin
him
.
And
lastly
,
I
vow
and
protest
that
I
do
not
understand
how
any
<NUMBER>
should
have
known
that
this
parcel
was
in
my
house
;
and
,
above
all
,
how
I
can
be
deemed
criminal
for
having
received
what
my
illustrious
and
unfortunate
godfather
brought
to
my
house
.
''
Another
observed
that
the
love
of
tulips
agreed
perfectly
well
with
that
of
politics
,
and
that
it
was
proved
in
history
that
many
very
dangerous
men
were
engaged
in
<UNK>
,
just
as
if
it
had
been
their
profession
,
whilst
really
they
occupied
themselves
with
perfectly
different
concerns
;
witness
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
grew
<UNK>
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
watered
his
<UNK>
at
the
dungeon
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
the
very
moment
when
the
former
meditated
his
return
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
latter
his
escape
from
prison
.
The
<UNK>
of
all
these
<UNK>
was
,
that
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
feel
infinitely
obliged
to
the
<UNK>
of

if
they
<UNK>
for
him
the
government
of
the
<NUMBER>
Provinces
by
destroying
even
the

germ
of
conspiracy
against
his
authority
.
There
the
Recorder
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
came
to
read
the
sentence
to
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
to
the
sentence
with
an
expression
rather
of
surprise
than
sadness
.
On
this
answer
,
the
Recorder
saluted
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
all
that
consideration
which
such
<UNK>
generally
bestow
upon
great
criminals
of
every
sort
.
``
And

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
what
hour
is
appointed

''
``
You
may
ask

''
The
head-dress
turned
round
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
beheld
the
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
blanched
with
grief
,
and
her
beautiful
eyes
streaming
with
tears
.
``
My

<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
with
emotion
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>

astonished

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
a
shudder
creeping
over
her
frame
,
for
,
whilst
the
prisoner
pronounced
these
words
,
the
belfry
clock
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
struck
eleven
.
That
was
at
a
time
when
I
did
not
know
that
there
was
anything
else
to
be
loved
.
Well

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
loved

dearly

and
I
have
found
,
or
at

I
believe
so
,
the
secret
of
the
great

which
it
has
been
considered
impossible

and
for
which
,
as
you
know

not
know

a
prize
of
a
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>

has
been
offered
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

I
am
alone
in
this

;
my

I
never

``
Well

with

you

I
ask
nothing

your

marry
a

and
who

loved

.
``
Listen
to
me
,
''
he
continued
:
``
I
'll
tell
you
how
to
manage
it

You
are
then
to
apprise
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
sobbed
afresh
,
and
handed
to
him
a
book
,
bound
in
shagreen
,
which
bore
the
initials
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
``
What
is
this
?
''
From
it
he
derived
strength
to
endure
the
torture
,
and
to
bear
his
sentence
without
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
kissed
it
<UNK>
.
This
was
the
pencil
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
lent
to
his
brother
,
and
which
he
had
forgotten
to
take
away
with
him
.
The
prisoner
then
,
giving
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
said
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
The
agony
of
the
poor

almost
overpowered
her

''
Oh
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
She
fell
on
her
knees
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
became
almost
senseless
.
that
is
impossible
for
me

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
showing
any
weakness
,
but
likewise
without
any
<UNK>
,
received
them
rather
as
friends
than
as
persecutors
,
and
quietly
submitted
to
all
those
preparations
which
these
men
were
obliged
to
make
in
performance
of
their
duty
.
Leaving
the
cell
,
the
young
man
could
still
see
in
the
convulsively
clinched
fingers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
yellowish
leaf
from
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
with
such
difficulty
and
pain
written
these
few
lines
,
which
,
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
read
them
,
would
undoubtedly
have
been
the
saving
of
a
man
and
a
tulip
.
The
shorter
the
way
from
the
door
of
the
prison
to
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
,
the
more
fully
,
of
course
,
it
was
crowded
with
curious
people
.
In
the
midst
of
these
threats
,
groans
,
and
yells
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
very
likely
in
order
not
to
hear
them
,
had
buried
himself
in
his
own
thoughts
.
``
It
is
only
<NUMBER>
stroke
of
the
axe
,
''
said
the
philosopher
to
himself
,
``
and
my
beautiful
dream
will
begin
to
be
<UNK>
.
''
At
length
the
fatal
moment
arrived
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
his
chin
on
the
cold
damp
block
.
<NUMBER>
times
he
felt
,
with
a
shudder
,
the
cold
current
of
air
from
the
knife
near
his
neck
,
but
what
a
surprise
!
He
looked
around
him
.
His
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
very
likely
afraid
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
blood
would
turn
the
scale
of
judgment
against
him
,
had
<UNK>
taken
into
consideration
his
good
character
,
and
the
apparent
proofs
of
his
innocence
.
To
use
an
expression
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
wrote
about
the
same
time
,
``
there
was
a
postscript
to
the
letter
;
''
and
the
most
important
part
of
the
letter
was
contained
in
the
postscript
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
forgot
that
the
<NUMBER>
Provinces
had
<NUMBER>
prisons
,
<NUMBER>
for
each
,
and
that
the
board
of
the
prisoner
is
anywhere
else
less
expensive
than
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
is
a
capital
.
``
I
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself
,
``
I
am
worth
much
less
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
he
exclaimed
,
``
how
damp
and
misty
that
part
of
the
country
is
,
and
the
soil
so
bad
for
the
tulips
!
He
was
invited
to
enter
it
,
and
he
obeyed
.
This
reprieve
suggested
to
the
worthy
spectators
remarks
such
as
the
following
:
-
``
It
's
very
fortunate
that
we
used
such
speed
in
having
justice
done
to
that
great
villain
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
to
that
little
rogue
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
otherwise
his
Highness
might
have
snatched
them
from
us
,
just
as
he
has
done
this
fellow
.
''
And
when
the
executioner
had
conducted
the
prisoner
to
the
scaffold
,
the
burgher
,
who
had
mounted
on
the
stone
of
the
<UNK>
the
better
to
see
and
be
seen
,
made
to
the
executioner
a
sign
which
meant
,
-
``
It
's
a
bargain
,
is
n't
it
?
''
He
had
therefore
<UNK>
up
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
hatred
,
whom
he
had
suspected
to
be
a
warm
friend
of
the
prisoner
,
making
trifling
inquiries
to
contrive
with
the
more
certainty
some
means
of
escape
for
him
.
He
therefore
was
not
able
to
admit
the
<UNK>
,
who
then
addressed
himself
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
offering
to
buy
her
a
head-dress
of
pure
gold
if
she
would
get
the
bulbs
for
him
.
He
therefore
clung
to
the
idea
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
suggested
:
he
went
to
the
executioner
.
But
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
died
.
It
was
money
lent
at
a
<NUMBER>
per
<UNK>
,
which
,
as
nobody
will
deny
,
was
a
very
handsome
investment
.
A
fanatic
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
very
easily
have
found
another
fanatic
who
would
give
a
<NUMBER>
guilders
for
his
remains
.
After
this
,
the
reader
may
imagine
how
excited
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
;
with
what
anxiety
he
watched
the
guards
,
the
Recorder
,
and
the
executioner
;
and
with
what
intense
interest
he
surveyed
the
movements
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
had
not
he
at
least
taken
care
to
enclose
them
in
a
golden
box
,
-
as
gold
is
the
<UNK>
of
all
<UNK>
?
Had
he
been
able
to
get
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
would
have
pounced
upon
him
and
strangled
him
.
<UNK>
were
,
however
,
nothing
to
him
.
It
was
indeed
in
itself
a
great
honour
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
be
confined
in
the
same
prison
which
had
once
received
the
learned
master
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
seemed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
an
auspicious
omen
that
this
very
cell
was
assigned
to
him
,
for
according
to
his
ideas
,
a
jailer
ought
never
to
have
given
to
a
second
pigeon
the
cage
from
which
the
first
had
so
easily
<UNK>
.
There
were
only
<NUMBER>
things
now
for
which

cared
,
and
the
possession
of
which
was
a

enjoyed
only
in

<NUMBER>
morning
,
whilst
at
his
window
inhaling
the
fresh
air
which
came
from
the
river
,
and
casting
a
longing
look
to
the
windmills
of
his
dear
old
city
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
were
<UNK>
in
the
distance
behind
a
forest

he
saw
flocks
of
pigeons
coming
from
that
quarter
to
perch
fluttering
on
the
pointed
<UNK>
of
Loewestein
.
A
man
grows
very
patient
who
is
<NUMBER>
years
of
age
,
and
condemned
to
a
prison
for
life
,
-
that
is
to
say
,
to
something
like
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
days
of
captivity
.
She
had
preserved
the
note
.
In
this
letter
there
was
a
little
note
enclosed
for

Seeing
this

the

<UNK>
from

<PROPER_NOUN>
to

these

with

visited
the

seeking

This

A

The

<PROPER_NOUN>

Did

In

<UNK>
to
put
the

into
the

;
leave
the

,
but
look
through
the
keyhole
of
the

and
watch
him
.
''
``
Oh
!
''
``
What
?
''
``
Indeed
he
did

''
you
are
depriving

''
he
cried
at
last
,
with
the
<UNK>
of
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
old
,
``
it
would
be
a
weakness

it
would
be
a
folly

it
would
be
a
meanness

``
Be

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
sweet
mixture
of
melancholy
and
gravity
,
``
be
easy

your

''
she
said
.
``
What
do
you
see

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
vexed
with
him
,
and
with
good
reason
.
From
what
he
had
said
she
was
more
ready
to
believe
that
he
dreamed
of
the
black
tulip
than
of
her
;
and
yet
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
mistaken
.
Therefore
,
although
he
might
find
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
pleasant
companion
for
the
<UNK>
hours
of
his
captivity
,
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
bestowing
his
heart
it
was
almost
certain
that
he
would
bestow
it
upon
a
tulip
,
-
that
is
to
say
,
upon
the
proudest
and
noblest
of
flowers
,
rather
than
upon
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
jailer
's
lowly
child
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
applied
herself
most
<UNK>
to
reading
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
second
fly
leaf
of
which
the
last
will
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
written
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
Having
finished
reading
,
she
took
her
pen
,
and
began
with
as
laudable
diligence
the
by
far
more
difficult
task
of
writing
.
The
tulip
,
indeed
,
was
still
a
luminous
and
prominent
object
in
his
mind
;
but
he
no
longer
looked
upon
it
as
a
treasure
to
which
he
ought
to
sacrifice
everything
,
and
even
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
as
a
marvellous
combination
of
nature
and
art
with
which
he
would
have
been
happy
to
adorn
the
bosom
of
his
beloved
<NUMBER>
.
The
words
which
he
had
said
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
evening
before
and
which
had
so
deeply
afflicted
her
,
now
came
back
to
his
mind
more
vividly
than
ever
,
and
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
told
his
gentle
<UNK>
to
sacrifice
him
to
his
tulip
,
-
that
is
to
say
,
to
give
up
seeing
him
,
if
need
be
,
-
whereas
to
him
the
sight
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
become
a
condition
of
life
.
All
was
then
silent
again
.
This
was
the
hour
at
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
generally
used
to
leave
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
he
thought
,
``
I
have
deserved
all
this
.
At
<NUMBER>
in
the
morning
,
the
door
of
his
cell
opened
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
even
turn
his
head
;
he
had
heard
the
heavy
step
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
lobby
,
but
this
step
had
perfectly
satisfied
the
prisoner
that
his
jailer
was
coming
alone
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
there
was
in
all
this
some
selfish
hope
to
hear
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
his
daughter
was
ill
.
At
the
second
visit
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
contrary
to
all
his
former
habits
,
asked
the
old
jailer
,
with
the
most
winning
voice
,
about
her
health
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
contented
himself
with
giving
the
<UNK>
answer
,
-
``
All
's
well
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
now
alone
once
more
;
it
was
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
the
anxiety
of
yesterday
returned
with
increased
intensity
.
In
his
wrath
he
would
have
strangled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
would
not
this
have
separated
him
for
ever
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
He
had
intended
to
fix
,
at
the
vainly
hoped
for
interview
,
the
following
day
as
the
time
for
that
momentous
operation
.
This
was
the
case
on
the
fourth
day
.
On
the
following
day
he
did
not
touch
them
at
all
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
carried
the
dishes
away
just
as
he
had
brought
them
.
``
Nonsense
!
''
He
will
get
out
of
it
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
chest
,
only
the
chest
will
be
a
coffin
.
''
And
,
rising
with
a
heavy
heart
,
she
returned
to
her
chamber
,
where
she
took
a
pen
and
paper
,
and
during
the
whole
of
that
night
busied
herself
with
tracing
letters
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
was
not
ill
,
she
was
offended
;
she
had
not
been
forcibly
prevented
from
coming
,
but
had
voluntarily
stayed
away
.
He
therefore
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
similar
to
that
which
he
had
received
,
-
``
It
was
not
my
anxiety
about
the
tulip
that
has
made
me
ill

.
''
For
<NUMBER>
days
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
seen
each

.
``
Yes

he
answered
,
as
indeed
he
was
suffering
in
mind
and
in
body
.
Seeing
your
return
,
my

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
thought
you
had
received
my
letter
.
''
``
Indeed
,
I
have
not
only
received
,
but
also
read
your
note
.
Saying
this
,
the
poor
prisoner
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
eyes
sparkling
with
hope
.
``
Oh
!
''
that
it
was
you
alone
whom
I
regretted
,
you
whom
I
missed
,
you
whose
absence
I
felt
more
than
the
loss
of
liberty
and
of
life
itself

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
trembled
involuntarily
,
and
showed
himself
clearly
to
be
caught
in
the
trap
,
if
ever
the
remark
was
meant
as
such
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
have
guessed
the
truth

that

and
amorous

my
account
.
''
``
Alas

he
said
,
``
I
know

I

asked

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
,
keeping
down
the
agitation
which
was
raging
in
his
breast
,
he
took
up
the
rake
,
smoothed
the
ground
,
so
as
to
leave
it
on
his
retiring
in
the

state
as
he
had
found
it
,
and
,
quite
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
,
walked
back
to

affecting

air
of
an
ordinary
visitor
of
the
garden
.

I
guessed
his

been
in

``

Here
<PROPER_NOUN>
heaved
a

at

that

was
,
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
owed
the

``

said

sighing
in

During

had
been
heavy

dark

and
lowering
,
as
it
were
,
with

on
the
unfortunate
captive
.
When
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
came
to
see
his
prisoner
in
the
morning
,
he
no
longer
found
him
<UNK>
and
lying
in
bed
,
but
standing
at
the
window
,
and
singing
a
little
<UNK>
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
-
``
Here
is
your
breakfast

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
What
conspiracy
?
''
Saying
this
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
out
.
It
was
very
easy
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
wait
for
<NUMBER>
at
midday
,
as
he
was
already
waiting
for
<NUMBER>
at

``
There

search

<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
been
sure

it
out
in

search
,
and
would
then
have
treated
it
as
he
did
the

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
burst
out
laughing
,
to
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
answered
through
the
grating
,
-
``
Let

Moreover
,
the
light
might
betray
her
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<UNK>
her
steps
more
than
ever
.
They
spoke
of
those
things
which
give
wings
to
the
hours
;
they
spoke
of
everything
except
the
black
tulip
.
But
why
did
<PROPER_NOUN>
object
to
the
tulip
being
spoken
of
?
After
having
fallen
asleep
,
he
dreamed
of
her
.
And
as
it
was
already
day
,
he
thought
it
right
not
to
fall
asleep
again
,
and
he
continued
following
up
the
line
of
thought
in
which
his
mind
was
engaged
when
he
awoke

That
meant
<NUMBER>
hours
given
to

it
was
<NUMBER>

stolen
from

!
``

with
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a

scream

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
allowed
him
to
press
her

in
his
,

to
keep
it
as
long
as

would

all

away

He
then
started
up

went
to

door

looked
through

grating

no

<UNK>
in

,
and
shot
through
the
whole

,
falling
down
,
as

,
on
the
fortress
of
Loewestein
.
And
as
if
he
had
guessed
correctly
,
nearly
at
that
very
moment
the
prisoner
heard
in
the
lobby
a
step
light
as
that
of
a
<UNK>
,
and
the
rustling
of
a
gown
,
and
a
well-known
voice
,
which
said
to
him
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Oh
!
''
``
It
is

my

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
letter
,
and
read
,
in
a
handwriting
which
was
much
improved
even
since
the
last
little
note
he
had
received
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
follows
:
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

-
The

<PROPER_NOUN>

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

What
no
one
but
a
tulip-fancier
,
and
an
envious
tulip-fancier
,
could
have
discovered
,
-
the
existence
of
the

and
the
<UNK>
of
the
prisoner
,
-
jealousy
had
enabled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
if
not
to
discover
,
at
least
to
guess
.
We
have
seen
how
his
imprudence
in
following
<PROPER_NOUN>
into
the
garden
had
<UNK>
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
damsel
,
and
how
the
instinctive
fears
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
put
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
on
their
guard
against
him
.
Only
as
this
time
he
followed
her
in
the
night
,
and
<UNK>
,
he
was
neither
seen
nor
heard
except
once
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
she
saw
something
like
a
shadow
on
the
staircase
.
He
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
washing
in
<UNK>
of
water
her
pretty
little
hands
,
<UNK>
as
they
were
with
the
mould
which
she
had
handled
,
to
give
her
tulip
the
best
soil
possible
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
watched
the
flower-pot
with
an
interest
which
betrayed
to
Boxtel
the
real
value
of
the
object
enclosed
in
it
.
When
the
sun
became
too
hot
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
likewise
took
in
the
pot
from
eleven
in
the
morning
until
<NUMBER>
in
the
afternoon
.
For
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
the
tender
secret
of
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
had
not
escaped
the
prying
curiosity
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
never
left
her
room
during
the
day
,
and
,
more
than
that
,
strange
to
say
,
she
never
left
it
in
the
evening
.
This
would
have
made
the
theft
much
more
difficult
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
at
first
expected
.
But
in
order
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
steal
the
tulip
,
it
was
necessary
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
should
leave
her
room
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
first
entertained
an
idea
of
stealing
the
key
,
but
it
soon
occurred
to
him
,
not
only
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
<UNK>
it
from
her
pocket
,
but
also
that
,
when
she
perceived
her
loss
,
she
would
not
leave
her
room
until
the
lock
was
changed
,
and
then
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
first
theft
would
be
useless
.
There
was
,
therefore
,
only
a
little
to
be
done
to
this
key
.
The
first
guilty
act
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
to
climb
over
a
wall
in
order
to
dig
up
the
tulip
;
the
second
,
to
introduce
himself
into
the
dry-room
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
through
an
open
window
;
and
the
third
,
to
enter
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
by
means
of
a
false
key
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
a
common
thief
,
and
he
reflected
.
This
was
a
<UNK>
scheme
,
and
quite
worthy
of
its
author
.
During
that
night
,
therefore
,
the
great
blow
was
to
be
struck
.
At
<NUMBER>
in
the
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
leaving
the
chamber
;
but
evidently
she
held
in
her
arms
something
which
she
carried
with
great
care
.
It
was
not
possible
that
a
young
girl
should
undertake
such
a
journey
alone
during
the
night
.
He
saw
her
approach
the
grated
window
.
He
saw
the
lips
of
the
lovers
meet
,
and
then
heard
<PROPER_NOUN>
send
<PROPER_NOUN>
away
.
And
in
that
hand
,
it
must
be
understood
,
he
held
the
false
key
which
opened
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
door
as
easily
as
did
the
real
<NUMBER>
.
Half
an
hour
passed
away
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
asked
the
prisoner
.
``
Speak

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
leaning
against
the

to
support
herself
;
``
yes

''
``
Oh

it
is
not
my

``

The

never

clinched

as

were

it

take

Seeing
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
distress
,
<UNK>
seized
the
iron
bars
of
the
grating
,
and
furiously
shaking
them
,
called
out
,
-

all
in

by

side
interrupted
her

roared
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

clasped

in
despair

well

Her
father
followed
her
,
growling
.
During
this
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
the
fortress
by
the
door
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
herself
had
opened
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
fearing
that
he
might
not
arrive
early
enough
,
procured
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
box
,
lined
all
round
with
fresh
moss
,
in
which
he
packed
the
tulip
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
leaving
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
fixed
on

plan

which
was
no

than

restore

or
never

itself

The

had
only
a

chaise
,
and
this
was
the
vehicle
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
hired
since
last

in

driving
along

for

<UNK>
her
horse
off
at
a
canter
,
she
soon
came
up
with
him
.
The
<NUMBER>
travellers
had
been
on
their

for
<NUMBER>
hours
,
and
made
more
than
<NUMBER>
leagues
,
and
yet
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
the

suspicion
of
his
daughter
having
left
the
fortress
.
Thus
the
prisoner
alone
was
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
him
to
be
.
The
<UNK>
of
the
fortress
was
sent
for
;
he
opened
the
door
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
no

slept

on

she
reached

beyond

the

at

uttering

This

was

in

and
the

exchanged
<NUMBER>
look
only

Soon
,
however
,
raising
his

with
an

,
he
said
,
in
his

,
-
``
Go

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
to
his
inn
,
rather
puzzled
and
uneasy
,
tormented
by
misgivings
about
that
paper
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
received
from
the
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
which
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
read

folded

so
carefully
put
in
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
not
having
received
any

persuaded
himself
that
all

was
the

work

that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
sent
on
earth
by

Alas
!
No

no
.
And
when
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
heated
his
brain
,
would
it
not
give
to
his
arm
,
which
had
been
only
too
well
set
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
even
double
force
?
And
certainly
in
these
moments
he
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
how
should
he
write
?
He
was
<NUMBER>
of
those

<UNK>
everything

lose

which
leads

Are
not
the

double

strength

the

But
luck
is
against
me
now

I

since
I
have
lost
the
joy

company
of

and
especially
since
I
have
lost

<PROPER_NOUN>
at
these
words
stopped
for
a
moment
,
biting
his
lips
and
staring
out
before
him
;
then
,
eagerly
returning
to
an
idea
which
seemed
to
possess
a
strange
fascination
for
him
,
he
continued
,
-
``
Well

and
once
having
strangled
him

why

down

some

Such
were
the

of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
days
after
the
sad
scene
of
separation

the
coolness

This
song
,
the
placid
melancholy
of
which
was
still
heightened
by
its
calm
and
sweet
melody
,
exasperated
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Ah

Are

``
I

calmly

``

mad

with

``

Why

is

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
his
large

quite
bewildered

``
Halloa

Then
,
as
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
anxious

know
something

of

had

fiercely
exasperated
his

spoke
first
by
putting

``

It
was
not

before
<PROPER_NOUN>
begged
for
mercy

In
fact
,
appearances
were
sadly
against
him
.
During
this
time
,
the
guards
who
had
seized
<PROPER_NOUN>
busied
themselves
in
<UNK>
informing
their
prisoner
of
the
usages
and
customs
of
Loewestein
,
which
however
he
knew
as
well

they
did

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
taken
within
<NUMBER>

from
his
cell
,
then
led
to
the
jailer

lodge

where
he
was
registered

then
taken
to
the

is
a

country

<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
with
the

attention
to
this
delightful
recital
,
and
then
said
,
-
``
Ah

``
Thank

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
he
asked
.
``
Where
is
the
prisoner
?
''
``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
heart
felt
oppressed
by
the

dread
of

what

I
tell

``
You

''
``
Come

``
It

answered
the
officer
.
<UNK>
counted
the
steps
which
led
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
regretting
that
he
had
not
asked
the

in
his
official

And

worst

and
regain
his

in

with
no

should

But
they
were
not
standing
in

or
carrying
muskets
,
but
talking
together
so
gayly
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
almost
shocked

said
the
officer
,
laughing
,
``
it
is
quite
natural
that
this
worthy

The
unfortunate

then
felt
that
he
had
no

no

resigned
himself

``
Ah

It

The
carriage
drove
away

The
carriage
rolled
on
during
the

day
;
it
passed
on
the
right
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

went
through
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
reached

That

would
undoubtedly
have
given

Toward
evening
,
an

called
at

<PROPER_NOUN>

house

<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
his
writing
for
a

;
then
,
raising
his

and
seeing

standing
near
the

he
said

without
laying
down
his
pen
,
-
``
Come

The

finished
his

Then
,
turning
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
fixing
on
her
his
<UNK>
,
and
at
the

time
impenetrable
glance
,
he
said
,
-
``
Now

my

<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
tremble

yet
there
was
nothing

All

started
back
a

``
Since

After
a

silence

he
resumed
the

just

when

In

with

At

shone

<PROPER_NOUN>

dressed

Behind

who
were

marched
the

The

and
as

The

neither

the

the

is
not

He
borrowed
a
little
importance
from
everybody
to
make
a
kind

false
importance
for

,
as
he
had
stolen
<PROPER_NOUN>

to
effect
his

glory

And
yet
,
if

must
be
told
,
this
wretch
,
who
had
stolen
what
was
the
boast
of
man
,
and
the
dowry
of
a
woman

did
not
consider
himself

And
the

raised
on
its
pedestal

soon
overlooked
the
assembled

who
clapped
their

made

Notwithstanding
the
little
readiness
which
his

had
shown

fate

he
ventured
once

to
ask
the
meaning
of
all
this
bustle

which
at
first
sight
seemed
to
be
utterly
<UNK>
with
his
own
affairs
.
``
Ah
,
a
feast

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
the
sad
tone
of
indifference
of

no
joy
remains
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
's
cheek
flushed
,
his

frame
trembled
,

the

sweat
stood
on
his
brow

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

thrusting
half
his

out
of

window

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

made

a

<PROPER_NOUN>
cried

Seeing
the
man
gesticulate
with
imploring
mien
,
and
perhaps
also
<UNK>
the
officer
who
accompanied
him
,
his
Highness
ordered
his
carriage
to
stop
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
cried
,
``

your

''
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
curious
spectacle
to
see
these
<NUMBER>
men
at
the
windows
of
their
several
carriages
;
the

surrounded
by

the

going
to
mount
a
throne
,
the

believing
himself
to
be
on
his

to
the
scaffold

His
good-tempered
honest
face
turned
pale
and
red
at
the

instant
.
``
Thank
you

<PROPER_NOUN>
,

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
nearly
<UNK>
with
joy
,
and
staggering
on
the
steps
of
his
carriage
;
had
not
the
officer
supported
him
,
our
poor
friend
would
have
made
his
thanks
to
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
prostrate
on
his
knees
with
his
forehead
in
the
dust
.
He
saw
it
at
last
,
that
<UNK>
flower
,
which
he
was
to
see
once
and
no
more
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
,
casting
a
tranquil
glance
over
the
enthusiastic
crowd
,
and
his
keen
eyes
rested
by

on
the
<NUMBER>
extremities
of
a
triangle
formed
opposite
to
him
by
<NUMBER>
persons
of
very
different
interests

feelings
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
then
slowly
unfolded
the
parchment
,
and
said
,
with
a
calm
clear
voice
,
which
,
although
low
,
made
itself
perfectly
heard
amidst
the
respectful
silence
,
which
all
at
once
arrested
the
breath
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
spectators
.
``
The

He
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
make
an

he
saw
the

taking
care

push

forward
towards
him
.

at

<PROPER_NOUN>
took

And

saying

the

handed

Immediately

Long

this

quitted

settled
on
the

land

it

leaning

was
a

of

or
two-and-twenty

who
was
looking
at
her
with
an
air
in
which
vexation
and
uneasiness
were
mingled
.
``
Well

shaking

The
young

made
a
gesture
of
rage

to
seek
a
quarrel

a

arose

up

down

with

fall
his

heaved
a

looking

rushing
towards

she
opened

hot

wiped

slowly
entered

somewhat

somewhat

of

poor
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
O

No
sooner
had
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
the
salon
,
than
he
assumed
the
grave
air
of
a
man
who
holds
the
balance
of
life
and
death
in
his
hands
.
He
was
about
to
marry
a
young

charming
woman

whom
he
loved
,
not
passionately
,
but
reasonably
,
as
became
a
deputy
attorney
of

and
besides
her
personal
attractions
,
which
were
very
great
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

family
possessed
considerable
political
influence

which
they
would

of

,
<UNK>
in

favor

The
sight
of
this
officer
recalled
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
the
third
heaven
to
earth
;
he
composed
his
face
,
as
we
have
before
described
,
and
said
,
``
I
have
read
the

Is

This
give
us
sounded
revolutionary
in
the
deputy

ears

As
he
had
now
arrived
at
the

of
his

house

which
<UNK>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

stood
,
as

petrified
,
on
the
spot
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
him
.
He
had
recognized
intelligence
in
the
high
forehead
,
courage
in
the
dark
eye
and
bent
brow
,
and
frankness
in
the
thick
lips
that
showed
a
set
of
pearly
teeth
.
He
was
pale
,
but
calm
and
collected
,
and
saluting
his
judge
with
easy
politeness
,
looked
round
for
a
seat
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
salon
.
``
My
name

replied
the
young

calmly
;
``
I

``
Go
on

he
.
``

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

Thus
all
my

I
will

public

private

for
he
was
scarcely
a

simple

natural

eloquent

that

never
found

sought
for

full
of
affection
for
everybody

because
he
was
happy

and
because
happiness
renders
even
the
wicked
good

extended
his
affection
even
to
his
judge
,
spite
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
severe
look
and
stern
accent
.
I
shall
have
at

a
pressure
of
the
hand
in
public

and
a
sweet
kiss
in
private

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
my

not
sufficiently

Here
is
the
paper
;

know

<UNK>
did
it
writes
well

And
<PROPER_NOUN>
threw
disdainfully
on
his
desk

letter

had
just
given
back
to
him

Then
,
<UNK>
,
``

At
these

he
gave
me
a
ring

Everywhere

dying

are
sacred

but
with

the

I
undertook

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
no

raised
his

at
the

a

and
again
perused
the

<UNK>
in

``
Swear
it

<PROPER_NOUN>
whispered
some
words
in
his
ear
,
to
which
the
officer
replied
by
a
motion
of
his
head
.
``
Alas
,
alas

murmured
he
,
``

said
he
,
``

from

I

A
door
that
communicated
with
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
opened
,
and
they
went
through
a
long
range
of
gloomy
corridors
,
whose
appearance
might
have
made
even
the
<UNK>
shudder
.
The
door
opened
,
the
<NUMBER>
gendarmes
gently
pushed
him
forward
,
and
the
door
closed
with
a
loud
sound
behind
him
.
It
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
<NUMBER>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
the
prisoner
was
soon
buried
in
darkness
.
He
had
advanced
at
first
,
but
stopped
at
the
sight
of
this
display
of
force
.
``
By
the
orders
of
the
deputy
procureur
?
''
``
Is
this
carriage
for
me
?
''
The
prisoner
glanced
at
the
windows
-
they
were
grated
;
he
had
changed
his
prison
for
another
that
was
conveying
him
he
knew
not
whither
.
``
Can
all
this
force
be
summoned
on
my
account

They
advanced
towards
a
boat
,
which
a
custom-house
officer
held
by
a
chain
,
near
the
quay
.
The
prisoner
's
first
feeling
was
of
joy
at
again
breathing
the
pure
air
-
for
air
is
freedom
;
but
he
soon
sighed
,
for
he
passed
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
he
had
that
morning
been
so
happy
,
and
now
through
the
open
windows
came
the
laughter
and
<UNK>
of
a
ball
.
This
manoeuvre
was
incomprehensible
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
But
still
''
-
``
We
are
forbidden
to
give
you
any

He

this
seemed

left
the

where
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
stood
,
on
the

and
were
now
opposite
the
Point
des
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
only
<NUMBER>
awake
in
the
whole
settlement
.
He
remained
silent
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
light
;
the
boat
went
on
,
but
the
prisoner
thought
only
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
spite
of
his
repugnance
to
address
the
guards
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
to
the
nearest
gendarme
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
<UNK>
you
,
as
a
Christian
and
a
soldier

to
tell
me
where
we
are
going

Have
you
no
idea
whatever

''
Tell
me

I
entreat

''
``
Unless
you
are
blind

or

''
This
gloomy
fortress
,
which
has
for
more
than
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
years
furnished
food
for
so
many
wild
<UNK>
,
seemed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
like
a
scaffold
to
a
malefactor
.
``
I
am
not
going
there
to
be
imprisoned

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
it
is
only
used

''
``
Without
any
inquiry
,
without
any
formality

''
But
what
are
you
doing
?
``
Good

''
For
a
moment
the
idea
of
struggling
crossed
his
mind
,
and
of
so
ending
the
unexpected
evil
that
had
overtaken
him
.
<NUMBER>
of
the
sailors
leaped
on
shore
,
a
cord
creaked
as
it
ran
through
a
<UNK>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
guessed
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
and
that
they
were
<UNK>
the
boat
.
They
halted
for
a
minute
,
during
which
he
strove
to
collect
his
thoughts
.
They
seemed
awaiting
orders
.
``
Here
,
''
replied
the
gendarmes
.
The
prisoner
followed
his
guide
,
who
led
him
into
a
room
almost
under
ground
,
whose
bare
and
<UNK>
walls
seemed
as
though
impregnated
with
tears
;
a
lamp
placed
on
a
stool
illumined
the
apartment
faintly
,
and
showed
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
features
of
his
conductor
,
an
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
and
of
sullen
appearance
.
In
the
meantime
there
is
bread
,
water
,
and
fresh
straw
;
and
that
is
all
a
prisoner
can
wish
for
.
With
the
first
dawn
of
day
the
jailer
returned
,
with
orders
to
leave
<PROPER_NOUN>
where
he
was
.
He
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
``
I
do
not
know

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
I
do

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hands
towards
the
open
door
;
but
the
door
closed
.
He
had
no
fears
as
to
how
he
should
live
-
good
seamen
are
welcome
everywhere
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
jailer
,
``
are
you
more
reasonable
to-day

``
I

already
told

The
jailer
saw
by
his
tone
he
would
be
happy
to
die
;
and
as
every
prisoner
is
worth
<NUMBER>
sous
a
day
to
his

,
he
replied
in
a
more
subdued
tone
.
``
It
is
too
long
a

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
whirled
the
stool
round
his
head
.
The
jailer
went
out
,
and
returned
in
an
instant
with
a
corporal
and
<NUMBER>
soldiers

The
soldiers
seized

and
on
entering
the
house
found
that
the

had
left
at
table
were
taking
coffee
in

salon

``

cried

asked
the

remarking
the

on

``
Alas

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

The

looked
at

The

took
his

,

they
left
the
salon

All
my

``
Yes

''
And
,
sitting
down
,
he
wrote
a

ordering
him
to
sell
out
at

``
Tell

The
marquis
rang
,
a
servant
entered
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastily
quitted
the
apartment
,
but
reflecting
that
the
sight
of
the
deputy
procureur
running
through

streets
would
be
enough
to
throw

into
confusion

he
resumed

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
spoken

recognized

strove

addressed

is
not
thus
banished

like

he
carried
the

in
his

,
arrived
at
the
salon
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
sob
,
and
sank
into
a
chair

He
had
frequently
called
for
capital
punishment
on
criminals
,
and
owing
to
his
irresistible
eloquence
they
had
been
condemned
,
and
yet
the
slightest
shadow
of
remorse
had
never
clouded
<PROPER_NOUN>

brow

because
they
were
guilty
;
at

,
he
believed
so
;
but
here
was
an
innocent
man
whose
happiness
he
had
destroyed
:
in
this
case
he
was
not
the

the
executioner

<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
,
or
rather
sprang
,
from
his
chair
,
hastily
opened
<NUMBER>
of
the
drawers
of
his
desk

emptied
all
the
gold
it
contained
into
his
pocket
,
stood
motionless
an

,
his
hand
pressed
to
his

,
muttered
a

inarticulate
sounds
,
and
then
,
perceiving
that
his

had
placed
his
cloak
on
his
shoulders
,
he
sprang
into
the
carriage
,
ordering
the

to
drive

Alas

her

were
wholly
personal

she
was
thinking

She
had
met

at

declaring

True

returned
the

Besides

he

almost

in

he
will
be
quite

Now
we

This
was
the
inspector

first
visit
;
he
wished
to
display
his
authority

Seeing
a

escorted
by

accompanied

The

listened
attentively

turning

observed
,
``
He

the

with

``

They

<PROPER_NOUN>

those

have
accorded

in

It

<UNK>

to

The
greatest
watchfulness
and
care
to
be
exercised
.
Days
and
weeks
passed
away
,
then
months
-
Dantes
still
waited
;
he
at
first
expected
to
be
freed
in
a
fortnight
.
He
took
with
him
several
of
his
subordinates
,
and
amongst
them
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
'
jailer
.
He
was
sustained
at
first
by
that
pride
of
conscious
innocence
which
is
the
<UNK>
to
hope
;
then
he
began
to
doubt
his
own
innocence
,
which
justified
in
some
measure
the
governor
's
belief
in
his
mental
<UNK>
;
and
then
,
<UNK>
his
sentiment
of
pride
,
he
addressed
his
supplications
,
not
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
to
man
.
He
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
walk
about
,
to
have
fresh
air
,
books
,
and
writing
materials
.
Often
,
before
his
captivity
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
mind
had
revolted
at
the
idea
of
<UNK>
of
prisoners
,
made
up
of
thieves
,
<UNK>
,
and
murderers
.
He
besought
the
jailer
<NUMBER>
day
to
let
him
have
a
companion
,
were
it
even
the
mad
abbe
.
All
the
pious
ideas
that
had
been
so
long
forgotten
,
returned
;
he
recollected
the
prayers
his
mother
had
taught
him
,
and
discovered
a
new
meaning
in
every
word
;
for
in
prosperity
prayers
seem
but
a
mere
<UNK>
of
words
,
until
misfortune
comes
and
the
unhappy
sufferer
first
understands
the
meaning
of
the
sublime
language
in
which
he
<UNK>
the
pity
of
heaven
!
Then
gloom
settled
heavily
upon
him
.
No
distraction
could
come
to
his
aid
;
his
energetic
spirit
,
that
would
have
exalted
in
thus
<UNK>
the
past
,
was
imprisoned
like
an
eagle
in
a
cage
.
Then
the
letter
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
showed
to
him
recurred
to
his
mind
,
and
every
line
gleamed
forth
in
fiery
letters
on
the
wall
like
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Unhappy
he
,
who
,
on
the
brink
of
misfortune
,
<UNK>
over
ideas
like
these
!
There
is
a
sort
of
consolation
at
the
contemplation
of
the
yawning
abyss
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lie
darkness
and
obscurity
.
``
Sometimes
,
''
said
he
,
``
in
my
voyages
,
when
I
was
a
man
and
commanded
other
men
,
I
have
seen
the
heavens
<UNK>
,
the
sea
rage
and
foam
,
the
storm
arise
,
and
,
like
a
monstrous
bird
,
beating
the
<NUMBER>
horizons
with
its
wings
.
But
now
it
is
different
;
I
have
lost
all
that
bound
me
to
life
,
death
smiles
and
<UNK>
me
to
repose
;
I
die
after
my
own
manner
,
I
die
exhausted
and
<UNK>
,
as
I
fall
asleep
when
I
have
paced
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
times
round
my
cell
.
''
But
the
first
was
repugnant
to
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
,
``
I
wish
to
die
,
''
and
had
chosen
the
manner
of
his
death
,
and
fearful
of
changing
his
mind
,
he
had
taken
an
oath
to
die
.
<UNK>
made
viands
once
repugnant
,
now
acceptable
;
he
held
the
plate
in
his
hand
for
an
hour
at
a
time
,
and
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
morsel
of
bad
meat
,
of
<UNK>
fish
,
of
black
and
<UNK>
bread
.
Then
he
raised
to
his
lips
the
repast
that
,
like
a
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
refused
himself
;
but
he
thought
of
his
oath
,
and
he
would
not
break
it
.
Thus
the
day
passed
away
.
So
many
<UNK>
animals
inhabited
the
prison
,
that
their
noise
did
not
,
in
general
,
awake
him
;
but
whether
abstinence
had
quickened
his
faculties
,
or
whether
the
noise
was
really
louder
than
usual
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
head
and
listened
.
Perhaps
<NUMBER>
of
those
beloved
ones
he
had
so
often
thought
of
was
thinking
of
him
,
and
striving
to
diminish
the
distance
that
separated
them
.
Some
hours
afterwards
it
began
again
,
nearer
and
more
distinct
.
The
jailer
brought
him
his
breakfast
.
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
''
thought
he
;
``
it
is
some
prisoner
who
is
striving
to
obtain
his
freedom
.
It
was
easy
to
call
his
jailer
's
attention
to
the
noise
,
and
watch
his
countenance
as
he
listened
;
but
might
he
not
by
this
means
destroy
hopes
far
more
important
than
the
<UNK>
satisfaction
of
his
own
curiosity
?
He
had
often
heard
that
shipwrecked
persons
had
died
through
having
eagerly
devoured
too
much
food
.
If
it
is
a
workman
,
I
need
but
knock
against
the
wall
,
and
he
will
cease
to
work
,
in
order
to
find
out
who
is
knocking
,
and
why
he
does
so
;
but
as
his
occupation
is
<UNK>
by
the
governor
,
he
will
soon
resume
it
.
At
the
first
blow
the
sound
ceased
,
as
if
by
magic
.
``
It
is
a
prisoner
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
joyfully
.
At
intervals
he
listened
to
learn
if
the
noise
had
not
begun
again
,
and
grew
impatient
at
the
prudence
of
the
prisoner
,
who
did
not
guess
he
had
been
disturbed
by
a
captive
as
anxious
for
liberty
as
himself
.
The
matter
was
no
longer
doubtful
.
He
saw
nothing
,
he
had
no
knife
or
sharp
instrument
,
the
window
grating
was
of
iron
,
but
he
had
too
often
assured
himself
of
its
solidity
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
but
<NUMBER>
resource
,
which
was
to
break
the
jug
,
and
with
<NUMBER>
of
the
sharp
fragments
attack
the
wall
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
all
the
night
to
work
in
,
but
in
the
darkness
he
could
not
do
much
,
and
he
soon
felt
that
he
was
working
against
something
very
hard
;
he
pushed
back
his
bed
,
and
waited
for
day
.
He
returned
speedily
,
advised
the
prisoner
to
be
more
careful
,
and
departed
.
During
the
<NUMBER>
years
that
he
had
been
imprisoned
,
what
might
he
not
have
accomplished
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
strove
to
do
this
with
his
nails
,
but
they
were
too
weak
.
The
jailer
always
brought
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
soup
in
an
iron
saucepan
;
this
saucepan
contained
soup
for
both
prisoners
,
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
noticed
that
it
was
either
quite
full
,
or
half
empty
,
according
as
the
turnkey
gave
it
to
him
or
to
his
companion
first
.
This
time
he
could
not
blame
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Leave
the
saucepan
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
you
can
take
it
away
when
you
bring
me
my
breakfast
.
''
He
rapidly
devoured
his
food
,
and
after
waiting
an
hour
,
lest
the
jailer
should
change
his
mind
and
return
,
he
removed
his
bed
,
took
the
handle
of
the
saucepan
,
inserted
the
point
between
the
<UNK>
stone
and
rough
stones
of
the
wall
,
and
employed
it
as
a
lever
.
Then
,
wishing
to
make
the
best
use
of
his
time
while
he
had
the
means
of
labor
,
he
continued
to
work
without
ceasing
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
So
for
the
future
I
hope
you
will
not
be
so
<UNK>
.
''
All
day
he
<UNK>
on
<UNK>
,
and
by
the
evening
he
had
succeeded
in
<UNK>
<NUMBER>
handfuls
of
plaster
and
fragments
of
stone
.
Having
poured
out
the
soup
,
the
turnkey
retired
.
However
,
he
<UNK>
on
all
the
night
without
being
discouraged
;
but
after
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
hours
he
encountered
an
obstacle
.
``
O
my

,
my

''
said
a
voice
that
seemed
to
come
from
beneath
the
earth
,
and
,
deadened
by
the
distance
,
sounded
hollow
and
sepulchral
in
the
young
man
's
ears
.
``
In
the

''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

``

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
made
no

answering

``

``

He
abdicated

``

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
fancied
he
heard
a

from

``

He
would
no

He
sat
down
occasionally
on

pressing
his

on
his
heart

The

came
in
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not

Then
from

he
saw
appear

first
the
head
,
then
the
shoulders
,
and
lastly
the
body
of
a
man
,
who
sprang
lightly
into
his
cell
.
His
thin
face
,
deeply
furrowed
by
care
,
and
the
bold
outline
of
his
strongly
marked
features
,
betokened
a
man
more
accustomed
to
exercise
his
mental
faculties
than
his
physical
strength
.
He
thanked
him
with
grateful
cordiality
for
his
kindly
welcome

although
he
must
at
that

have
been
suffering
bitterly
to
find
another
dungeon

he
had
fondly
reckoned
on
discovering
a
means
of
regaining
his
liberty

``

``

responded
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
almost
terrified

no

``

up

said
he
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
and
sliding
from
the
shoulders
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
<UNK>
as
he
had
ascended
,
he
<UNK>
leaped
from
the
table
to
the
ground
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
at
length
,
``
it
is
so
.
I
saw
the
soldier

shape

the

of
his
musket
;
that

me
draw
in
my

so
quickly

I
was
fearful
he

``
Then

pursued
the

eagerly

answered
the

he
at

;
``
never

The
stranger
smiled
a
melancholy
smile
.
It
was
at
this
period
I
learned
that
the
destiny
which
seemed
<UNK>
to
every
wish
formed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>

had
bestowed
on
him

some

some

a

who
becomes
a

``
Probably

I
get
out

It
was
the
plan
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
understand
a

risking
his

``

he
asked

remained
for
a
short
time
mute

motionless
;
at
length
he
said
,
-

Why
not
try
to
find
an
opening
in
another
direction
from
that
which
has
so
unfortunately
failed
?
''
Consider
also
that
I
fully
believed
I
had
accomplished
the

aim

I
had
so

my

Another

had
attempted
what

sufficient

had
failed
only
because

He
could
do

in

how
many

had
he

for
pure

continued
in

he

raising

The
floor
of

cell
was
paved
,

it
had
been
by
raising
<NUMBER>

in

``

then

the

Each

as

Dantes
examined

intense

They
put

the

sprinkled
a

opening

he
showed

a

with

eye
for

a

In
this

he
proposed
to
drive
a

this

would

Nothing
interrupted
the

work

the
necessity

was
under

returning
to

The

a

had

mixed
in

hastened
to

found

standing

pale
as

I

So
sudden
and
violent
was
the
fit
that
the

was
unable

Dantes
prevented

by
covering

<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
fear

thrusting

continued
gazing

cried

The

sprang
to

darted
through

carefully
drawing
the

over

hurried

the

``

he
seated

The

raised

exclaimed

sat
up

shuddered
when

heard
the

made

He
was
not
rich
,
although
the
wealth

had
passed
into
a

,
and
I
heard
the

very

`
As

I

<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
formidable
still
in
spite
of
his
recent
reverses
;
and
it
was
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
have
recourse
to
some
profitable
scheme
,
which
was
a

of
great
difficulty
in
the

exhausted
<PROPER_NOUN>

In
the

he
could
sell
the

splendid

the

already
held

then
he
had
the

The
result
was

that
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
for
being
cardinals

<NUMBER>
other
persons
paid
for
the

held
before
their
elevation
,
and
thus
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
crowns
entered
into
the
coffers
of
the
speculators
.
This
was
a
matter
of
dispute
between
the
holy
father
and
his

.
Then
there
was
the
ring
with
the
lion

head

which
<PROPER_NOUN>
wore
when

wanted

greet

<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
way
before
such

reasoning
,
and
the
cardinals
were
consequently
invited
to
dinner

He
then
sent
word
to
his

to
wait
for
him
near
the
vineyard
;
but
it
appeared
the
servant
did
not
find
him

The

awaited
him

The
nephew
replied
no
;
perfectly
comprehending
the

the
question

<PROPER_NOUN>
died
on
the
threshold
of
the
vineyard
;
the

expired
at
his

,
making
signs

his

could
not

That
was
all
.
<UNK>
and
years
rolled
on

Then
,
compelled
to
quit
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
went

killed
in
a

scarcely

``

Years
rolled

amongst

some

some

all

and
had
gradually

the

taught
his

the

<NUMBER>
night
<PROPER_NOUN>
awoke
suddenly

believing
that

heard
some

calling
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
call
came
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
dungeon
.
His
features
were
writhing
with
those
horrible
symptoms
which
he
already
knew
,
and
which
had
so
seriously
alarmed
him
when
he
saw
them
for
the
first
time

``
Silence

he
said
,
``

Perhaps

like

and
then
resuming
all
his
presence
of
mind
,
which
had
for
a
moment
staggered
under
this
blow
,
and
his
strength
,
which
had
failed
at
the
words
of
the
old

,
he
said
,
``
Oh

I

tell

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
``

reach

there
will
be
nothing
left
of
me

a

you

Help

Oh

At

we
have

it

the
privilege

see

more

And
raising
himself
by
a
final
effort
,
in
which
he
summoned
all
his
faculties
,
he
said
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
forget
not

''
With
steady
gaze
he
awaited
<UNK>
the
moment
for
administering
the
<UNK>
.
Then
he
thought
it
was
time
to
make
the
last
trial
,
and
he
put
the
phial
to
the
purple
lips
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
without
having
occasion
to
force
open
his
jaws
,
which
had
remained
extended
,
he
poured
the
whole
of
the
liquid
down
his
throat
.
Strange
shadows
passed
over
the
countenance
of
the
dead
man
,
and
at
times
gave
it
the
appearance
of
life
.
It
was
time
,
for
the
jailer
was
coming
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
then
seized
with
an
indescribable
desire
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
dungeon
of
his
unfortunate
friend
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
the
creaking
of
the
bed
as
they
moved
the
corpse
,
heard
the
voice
of
the
governor
,
who
asked
them
to
throw
water
on
the
dead
man
's
face
;
and
seeing
that
,
in
spite
of
this
application
,
the
prisoner
did
not
recover
,
they
sent
for
the
doctor
.
``
With

he

pay
for
his

``
They

the

''
He
remained
,
therefore
,
mute
and
motionless
,
hardly
venturing
to
breathe
.
The
inquiries
soon
commenced
.
``
Ah
,
''
added
the
turnkey
,
``
there
was
no

This
order
to
heat
the
irons
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
shudder
.
``
You
see
,

he
is
really
dead

said
the
doctor
;
``
this

``
Yes

said
the

inquired
a
turnkey
.
``
This

said
the

.

``
At

''
``
Of
what

would
it

It
was
empty
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
emerged
from
the
tunnel

No

could
<PROPER_NOUN>
look
into
those
<UNK>
eyes
which
had
seemed

be
penetrating

Alone

``

he
said
,
``
I

<PROPER_NOUN>
recoiled
from
the
idea
of
so
infamous
a
death
,
and
passed
suddenly
from
despair
to
an
ardent
desire
for
life
and
liberty
.
yes

had
I
died
years
ago
;
but
now
to
die
would
be

indeed

to
give
way

.
As
he
said
this
,
he
became
silent
and
gazed
straight
before
him
like
<NUMBER>
overwhelmed
with
a
strange
and
<UNK>
thought
.
Is
it
from
thee
?
Dantes
might
have
waited
until
the
evening
visit
was
over
,
but
he
was
afraid
that
the
governor
would
change
his
mind
,
and
order
the
dead
body
to
be
removed
earlier
.
If
they
took
him
to
the
cemetery
and
laid
him
in
a
grave
,
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
covered
with
earth
,
and
then
,
as
it
was
night
,
the
grave-diggers
could
scarcely
have
turned
their
backs
before
he
would
have
worked
his
way
through
the
yielding
soil
and
escaped
.
His
situation
was
too
precarious
to
allow
him
even
time
to
reflect
on
any

<NUMBER>

His

placed

was
unable

<UNK>
,
while
,
with
the

he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
temples
.
It
was
a
good
augury
.
The
door
opened
,
and
a
dim
light
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
eyes
through
the
coarse
sack
that
covered
him
;
he
saw
<NUMBER>
shadows
approach

``

``
Yes

replied
the
companion

<PROPER_NOUN>
stiffened
himself
in
order
to
play
the
part

a
dead
man
,
and
then
the
party

lighted
by

``

inquired

They
advanced
<NUMBER>

farther

then
stopped
to
open

,
then
went
forward
again
.
``
Why

the

runs
a

being
wet

said
the

;
and
then
there
was
a
burst
of
brutal
laughter
.
``
You

been
flung
into
the

was
dragged
into

depths
by
a

shot
tied

With
a
mighty
leap
he
rose
to
the

the
sea
,
while
the
shot
dragged
down
to
the
depths
the

had

become

Behind

<UNK>
than

rose

the

seemed
like

on

lighting

When

up

the

how

he

Often
in
prison
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
said
to
him

when

saw
him
idle

inactive

``

He
listened
for
any
sound
that
might
be
audible
,
and
every
time
that
he
rose
to
the
top
of
a
wave
he
scanned
the

,
and
strove
to
penetrate
the

An

passed
,
during
which
<PROPER_NOUN>

excited
by

continued
to
<UNK>
the

He
sought

tread

in

to
rest
himself
;
but
the
sea
was
too
violent
,
and
he
felt
that

could
not
make
use
of
this

of
<UNK>

Then
he
put
out
his
hand
,
and
encountered
an
obstacle
and
with
another
stroke
knew
that
he
had
gained
the
shore

which
seemed
to
him
softer

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not

He

in

As

rose
,
a

that
seemed

<UNK>
the

illumined
the

Another

showed

<NUMBER>
men
clinging

shattered

the

,
while
a

clung
to
the
broken

Dantes
from
his
rocky
perch
saw
the
shattered
vessel
,
and
among
the
fragments
the
floating
forms
of
the
<UNK>
sailors
.
Soon
a

became
visible
in

the

<UNK>

a

played
over

gilded
their

with
gold
.
The

building
rose
from

bosom

with
imposing
majesty

seemed
to
<UNK>
the
scene

Then
the

the

As
<PROPER_NOUN>
-LRB-
his
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
d'If
-RRB-
uttered
this

he
saw
off
the
farther
point
of
the
Island

a
small
vessel
with

sail
<UNK>
the

like

with
his

he
knew
it
to
be
a

What

In

my

be
utterly

;
besides
,
perhaps
I

not

at

The
red
cap
of
<NUMBER>

hung
to
a

some

had

and
stood
towards

At
the

he
saw
they
were
about
to
lower
the
boat
.
His
arms
became
stiff
,
his
legs
lost
their

and
he
was
almost
breathless
.
He
rose
again
to
the
surface
,
struggled
with
the
last
desperate
effort
of
a

,
uttered
a

felt

sinking

glanced

paused
with

'
arrest
.
He
renewed
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
oath
of
implacable
vengeance
he
had
made
in
his
dungeon
.
It
is
fair
to
assume
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
on
board
a
smuggler
.
This
made
him
less
uneasy
,
it
must
be
owned
,
than
if
the
new-comer
had
proved
to
be
a
customs
officer
;
but
this
supposition
also
disappeared
like
the
first
,
when
he
beheld
the
perfect
tranquillity
of
his
recruit
.
In
this
state
of
mutual
understanding
,
they
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
he
had
<NUMBER>
times
touched
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
remembered
a
barber
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
went
there
to
have
his
beard
and
hair
cut
.
When
the
operation
was
concluded
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
that
his
chin
was
completely
smooth
,
and
his
hair
reduced
to
its
usual
length
,
he
asked
for
a
<UNK>
.
The
oval
face
was
<UNK>
,
his
smiling
mouth
had
assumed
the
firm
and
marked
lines
which
<UNK>
resolution
;
his
eyebrows
were
arched
beneath
a
brow
furrowed
with
thought
;
his
eyes
were
full
of
melancholy
,
and
from
their
depths
occasionally
sparkled
gloomy
fires
of
misanthropy
and
hatred
;
his
complexion
,
so
long
kept
from
the
sun
,
had
now
that
pale
color
which
produces
,
when
the
features
are
encircled
with
black
hair
,
the
aristocratic
beauty
of
the
man
of
the
north
;
the
profound
learning
he
had
acquired
had
besides
diffused
over
his
features
a
refined
intellectual
expression
;
and
he
had
also
acquired
,
being
naturally
of
a
<UNK>
stature
,
that
vigor
which
a
frame
possesses
which
has
so
long
concentrated
all
its
force
within
itself
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
when
he
beheld
himself
:
it
was
impossible
that
his
best
friend
-
if
,
indeed
,
he
had
any
friend
left
-
could
recognize
him
;
he
could
not
recognize
himself
.
<UNK>
by
his
<UNK>
appearance
,
he
renewed
his
offers
of
an
engagement
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
his
own
projects
,
would
not
agree
for
a
longer
time
than
<NUMBER>
months
.
They
sailed
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
again
cleaving
the
azure
sea
which
had
been
the
first
horizon
of
his
youth
,
and
which
he
had
so
often
dreamed
of
in
prison
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
it
three-quarters
of
a
league
to
the
<UNK>
,
and
kept
on
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
What
would
the
patron
think
?
Besides
,
were
not
those
riches
chimerical
?
The
next
<UNK>
broke
off
the
coast
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
all
day
they
<UNK>
,
and
in
the
evening
saw
fires
lighted
on
land
;
the
position
of
these
was
no
doubt
a
signal
for
landing
,
for
a
ship
's
lantern
was
hung
up
at
the
<UNK>
instead
of
the
<UNK>
,
and
they
came
to
within
a
gunshot
of
the
shore
.
The
same
night
,
such
a
man
of
regularity
was
the
patron
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
profits
were
divided
,
and
each
man
had
a
<NUMBER>
Tuscan
livres
,
or
about
<NUMBER>
francs
.
This
new
cargo
was
destined
for
the
coast
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
consisted
almost
entirely
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
cigars
,
sherry
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
.
He
had
contemplated
danger
with
a
smile
,
and
when
wounded
had
exclaimed
with
the
great
philosopher
,
``
<UNK>
,
thou
art
not
an
evil
.
''
This
world
was
not
then
so
good
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
believed
it
,
neither
was
it
so
wicked
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
it
,
since
this
man
,
who
had
nothing
to
expect
from
his
comrade
but
the
inheritance
of
his
share
of
the
<UNK>
,
manifested
so
much
sorrow
when
he
saw
him
fall
.
But
this
sufficed
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
instinctively
felt
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
a
right
to
superiority
of
position
-
a
superiority
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
concealed
from
all
others
.
And
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
inquired
of
him
,
``
What
is
the
use
of
<UNK>
all
these
things
to
a
poor
sailor
like
me
?
''
We
had
forgotten
to
say
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
soon
as
his
engagement
with
the
patron
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
ended
,
he
would
hire
a
small
vessel
on
his
own
account
-
for
in
his
several
voyages
he
had
amassed
a
<NUMBER>
piastres
-
and
under
some
pretext
land
at
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
in
vain
did
he
rack
his
imagination
;
fertile
as
it
was
,
he
could
not
devise
any
plan
for
reaching
the
island
without
companionship
.
It
was
necessary
to
find
some
neutral
ground
on
which
an
exchange
could
be
made
,
and
then
to
try
and
land
these
goods
on
the
coast
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
When
he
again
joined
the
<NUMBER>
persons
who
had
been
discussing
the
matter
,
it
had
been
decided
that
they
should
touch
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
set
out
on
the
following
night
.
<NUMBER>
night
more
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
.
<UNK>
fell
drop
by
drop
,
as
subterranean
waters
<UNK>
in
their
caves
.
The
day
came
at
length
,
and
was
almost
as
feverish
as
the
night
had
been
,
but
it
brought
reason
to
the
aid
of
imagination
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
then
enabled
to
arrange
a
plan
which
had
hitherto
been
vague
and
<UNK>
in
his
brain
.
He
saw
in
the
young
man
his
natural
successor
,
and
regretted
that
he
had
not
a
daughter
,
that
he
might
have
bound
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
him
by
a
more
secure
alliance
.
When
the
Maltese
-LRB-
for
so
they
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
-RRB-
had
said
this
,
it
was
sufficient
,
and
all
went
to
their
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
When
the
patron
awoke
,
the
vessel
was
hurrying
on
with
every
sail
set
,
and
every
sail
full
with
the
breeze
.
<NUMBER>
hours
afterwards
he
came
on
deck
,
as
the
boat
was
about
to
double
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
About
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
evening
the
island
was
distinct
,
and
everything
on
it
was
plainly
perceptible
,
owing
to
that
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
peculiar
to
the
light
which
the
rays
of
the
sun
cast
at
its
setting
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
first
at
the
rendezvous
.
The
island
was
familiar
to
the
crew
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
it
was
<NUMBER>
of
her
regular
<UNK>
.
he
inquired
.
``
Why
,
the
grottos
-
caves
of
the
island
.
''
he
asked
.
It
was
useless
to
search
at
night
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
delayed
all
investigation
until
the
morning
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
reflected
,
as
he
worked
,
on
the
shout
of
joy
which
,
with
a
single
word
,
he
could
<UNK>
from
all
these
men
,
if
he
gave
utterance
to
the
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
thought
that
pervaded
his
heart
;
but
,
far
from
<UNK>
this
precious
secret
,
he
almost
feared
that
he
had
already
said
too
much
,
and
by
his
<UNK>
and
continual
questions
,
his
minute
observations
and
evident
<UNK>
,
aroused
suspicions
.
Scarcely
,
however
,
had
they
gone
a
quarter
of
a
league
when
,
having
killed
a
kid
,
he
begged
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
take
it
to
his
comrades
,
and
request
them
to
cook
it
,
and
when
ready
to
let
him
know
by
firing
a
gun
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
with
the
sad
and
gentle
smile
of
a
man
superior
to
his
fellows
.
Oh
,
no
!
''
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
but
<NUMBER>
months
before
had
no
desire
but
liberty
had
now
not
liberty
enough
,
and
<UNK>
for
wealth
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
<UNK>
all
physical
substances
with
its
<UNK>
mantle
,
as
it
<UNK>
all
things
of
the
mind
with
forgetfulness
,
seemed
to
have
respected
these
signs
,
which
apparently
had
been
made
with
some
degree
of
regularity
,
and
probably
with
a
definite
purpose
.
<UNK>
it
not
have
been
the
cardinal
himself
who
had
first
traced
them
,
in
order
that
they
might
serve
as
a
guide
for
his
nephew
in
the
event
of
a
catastrophe
,
which
he
could
not
foresee
would
have
been
so
complete
.
It
seemed
,
however
,
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
hidden
from
his
comrades
by
the
<UNK>
of
the
ground
,
that
at
<NUMBER>
paces
from
the
harbor
the
marks
ceased
;
nor
did
they
terminate
at
any
grotto
.
Just
at
the
moment
when
they
were
taking
the
dainty
animal
from
the
spit
,
they
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
springing
with
the
boldness
of
a
<UNK>
from
rock
to
rock
,
and
they
fired
the
signal
agreed
upon
.
He
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
lying
<UNK>
,
bleeding
,
and
almost
senseless
.
They
wished
to
carry
him
to
the
shore
;
but
when
they
touched
him
,
although
under
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
directions
,
he
declared
,
with
heavy
groans
,
that
he
could
not
bear
to
be
moved
.
They
were
hungry
,
and
the
smell
of
the
roasted
kid
was
very
<UNK>
,
and
your
<UNK>
are
not
very
ceremonious
.
The
old
patron
,
who
was
obliged
to
sail
in
the
morning
in
order
to
land
his
cargo
on
the
frontiers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
urged
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
try
and
rise
.
We
will
try
and
carry
him
on
board
the
tartan
.
''
This
very
much
astonished
the
sailors
,
although
,
not
<NUMBER>
opposed
it
.
Leave
me
a
small
supply
of
biscuit
,
a
gun
,
powder
,
and
balls
,
to
kill
the
kids
or
defend
myself
at
need
,
and
a
pickaxe
,
that
I
may
build
a
shelter
if
you
delay
in
coming
back
for
me
.
''
``
What
are
we
to
do
,
Maltese
?
''
exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
If
you
do
not
come
across
<NUMBER>
,
return
for
me
.
''
``
And
give
up
your
share
of
the
venture
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
to
remain
with
me
?
''
A
peculiar
smile
passed
over
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
lips
;
he
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
hand
warmly
,
but
nothing
could
shake
his
determination
to
remain
-
and
remain
alone
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
she
was
completely
out
of
sight
;
at
least
,
it
was
impossible
for
the
wounded
man
to
see
her
any
longer
from
the
spot
where
he
was
.
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
,
hidden
in
the
bushes
,
<UNK>
with
a
monotonous
and
dull
note
;
the
leaves
of
the
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
trees
waved
and
<UNK>
in
the
wind
.
This
feeling
was
so
strong
that
at
the
moment
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
begin
his
labor
,
he
stopped
,
laid
down
his
pickaxe
,
seized
his
gun
,
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
highest
rock
,
and
from
thence
gazed
round
in
every
direction
.
This
sight
reassured
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
traced
the
marks
along
the
rocks
,
and
he
had
noticed
that
they
led
to
a
small
creek
.
It
was
this
idea
that
had
brought
<PROPER_NOUN>
back
to
the
circular
rock
.
Instead
of
raising
it
,
thought
he
,
they
have
lowered
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
dug
away
the
earth
carefully
,
and
detected
,
or
fancied
he
detected
,
the
ingenious
artifice
.
But
the
rock
was
too
heavy
,
and
too
firmly
<UNK>
,
to
be
moved
by
any
<NUMBER>
man
,
were
he
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
.
He
smiled
;
the
infernal
invention
would
serve
him
for
this
purpose
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
approached
the
upper
rock
,
which
now
,
without
any
support
,
leaned
towards
the
sea
.
The
rock
yielded
,
rolled
over
,
bounded
from
point
to
point
,
and
finally
disappeared
in
the
ocean
.
This
feeling
lasted
but
for
a
moment
.
``
Come
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
be
a
man
.
The
heart
breaks
when
,
after
having
been
elated
by
flattering
hopes
,
it
sees
all
its
illusions
destroyed
.
And
he
remained
again
motionless
and
thoughtful
.
``
But
what
was
the
fate
of
the
guards
who
thus
possessed
his
secret
?
''
I
will
go
down
.
''
``
Alas
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
,
``
these
are
the
treasures
the
cardinal
has
left
;
and
the
good
abbe
,
seeing
in
a
dream
these
glittering
walls
,
has
indulged
in
<UNK>
hopes
.
''
Dantes
continued
his
search
.
However
,
he
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
knew
the
value
of
time
;
and
,
in
order
to
avoid
fruitless
toil
,
he
sounded
all
the
other
walls
with
his
pickaxe
,
struck
the
earth
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
,
and
finding
nothing
that
appeared
suspicious
,
returned
to
that
part
of
the
wall
whence
issued
the
consoling
sound
he
had
before
heard
.
The
aperture
of
the
rock
had
been
closed
with
stones
,
then
this
<UNK>
had
been
applied
,
and
painted
to
imitate
granite
.
This
last
proof
,
instead
of
giving
him
fresh
strength
,
deprived
him
of
it
;
the
pickaxe
descended
,
or
rather
fell
;
he
placed
it
on
the
ground
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
,
and
remounted
the
stairs
,
<UNK>
to
himself
,
as
an
excuse
,
a
desire
to
be
assured
that
no
one
was
watching
him
,
but
in
reality
because
he
felt
that
he
was
about
to
faint
.
After
several
blows
he
perceived
that
the
stones
were
not
cemented
,
but
had
been
merely
placed
<NUMBER>
upon
the
other
,
and
covered
with
<UNK>
;
he
inserted
the
point
of
his
pickaxe
,
and
using
the
handle
as
a
lever
,
with
joy
soon
saw
the
stone
turn
as
if
on
hinges
,
and
fall
at
his
feet
.
The
second
grotto
was
lower
and
more
gloomy
than
the
first
;
the
air
that
could
only
enter
by
the
newly
formed
opening
had
the
<UNK>
smell
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
surprised
not
to
find
in
the
outer
cavern
.
He
glanced
around
this
second
grotto
;
it
was
,
like
the
first
,
empty
.
At
the
fifth
or
sixth
blow
the
pickaxe
struck
against
an
iron
substance
.
``
It
is
a
casket
of
wood
bound
with
iron
,
''
thought
he
.
He
thought
a
moment
,
cut
a
branch
of
a
<UNK>
tree
,
lighted
it
at
the
fire
at
which
the
smugglers
had
prepared
their
breakfast
,
and
descended
with
this
torch
.
He
planted
his
torch
in
the
ground
and
resumed
his
labor
.
Dantes
seized
the
handles
,
and
strove
to
lift
the
coffer
;
it
was
impossible
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
seized
with
vertigo
;
he
cocked
his
gun
and
laid
it
beside
him
.
After
having
touched
,
felt
,
examined
these
treasures
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
through
the
<UNK>
like
a
man
seized
with
frenzy
;
he
leaped
on
a
rock
,
from
whence
he
could
behold
the
sea
.
This
time
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
,
clasping
his
hands
convulsively
,
uttered
a
prayer
intelligible
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
.
and
his
<UNK>
;
and
he
saw
that
the
<UNK>
was
not
half
empty
.
It
was
a
night
of
joy
and
terror
,
such
as
this
man
of
stupendous
emotions
had
already
experienced
twice
or
thrice
in
his
lifetime
.
<UNK>
into
the
grotto
,
he
lifted
the
stone
,
filled
his
pockets
with
gems
,
put
the
box
together
as
well
and
securely
as
he
could
,
sprinkled
fresh
sand
over
the
spot
from
which
it
had
been
taken
,
and
then
carefully
trod
down
the
earth
to
give
it
everywhere
a
uniform
appearance
;
then
,
quitting
the
grotto
,
he
replaced
the
stone
,
<UNK>
on
it
broken
masses
of
rocks
and
rough
fragments
of
<UNK>
granite
,
filling
the
interstices
with
earth
,
into
which
he
<UNK>
inserted
rapidly
growing
plants
,
such
as
the
wild
<UNK>
and
flowering
<UNK>
,
then
carefully
<UNK>
these
new
<UNK>
,
he
scrupulously
effaced
every
trace
of
footsteps
,
leaving
the
approach
to
the
cavern
as
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
as
he
had
found
it
.
From
a
distance
<PROPER_NOUN>
recognized
the
<UNK>
and
handling
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
dragging
himself
with
affected
difficulty
towards
the
landing-place
,
he
met
his
companions
with
an
assurance
that
,
although
considerably
better
than
when
they
quitted
him
,
he
still
suffered
<UNK>
from
his
late
accident
.
In
fact
,
the
pursuing
vessel
had
almost
overtaken
them
when
,
fortunately
,
night
came
on
,
and
enabled
them
to
double
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
so
<UNK>
all
further
pursuit
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
half
feared
that
such
valuable
jewels
in
the
hands
of
a
poor
sailor
like
himself
might
excite
suspicion
;
but
the
cunning
purchaser
asked
no
troublesome
questions
concerning
a
bargain
by
which
he
gained
a
round
profit
of
at
least
<NUMBER>
per
cent
.
The
term
for
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
engaged
to
serve
on
board
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
having
expired
,
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
took
leave
of
the
captain
,
who
at
first
tried
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
remain
as
<NUMBER>
of
the
crew
,
but
having
been
told
the
history
of
the
legacy
,
he
ceased
to
<UNK>
him
further
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
departed
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
bargain
was
therefore
struck
.
The
following
day
Dantes
sailed
with
his
yacht
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
under
the
inspection
of
an
immense
crowd
drawn
together
by
curiosity
to
see
the
rich
Spanish
nobleman
who
preferred
<UNK>
his
own
yacht
.
Some
insisted
she
was
making
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
others
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
<UNK>
were
offered
to
any
amount
that
she
was
bound
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
positively
reported
by
many
persons
as
her
intended
course
;
but
no
one
thought
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<UNK>
on
the
following
morning
he
commenced
the
<UNK>
of
his
riches
,
and
ere
<UNK>
the
whole
of
his
immense
wealth
was
safely
deposited
in
the
compartments
of
the
secret
<UNK>
.
Upon
the
eighth
day
he
discerned
a
small
vessel
under
full
sail
approaching
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
mournful
answer
awaited
each
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
eager
inquiries
as
to
the
information
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
obtained
.
<NUMBER>
of
the
men
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
boat
came
on
board
the
yacht
to
assist
in
<UNK>
it
,
and
he
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
steered
direct
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
looking-glass
had
assured
him
,
during
his
stay
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
he
ran
no
risk
of
recognition
;
moreover
,
he
had
now
the
means
of
adopting
any
disguise
he
thought
proper
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
welcomed
the
meeting
with
this
fellow
-
who
had
been
<NUMBER>
of
his
own
sailors
-
as
a
sure
means
of
<UNK>
the
extent
of
the
change
which
time
had
worked
in
his
own
appearance
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
said
the
honest
fellow
,
in
almost
breathless
haste
,
``
but
I
believe
you
made
a
mistake
;
you
intended
to
give
me
a
<UNK>
piece
,
and
see

you
gave
me
a
double

''
``
Some
nabob
from
<PROPER_NOUN>

was
his
<UNK>
.
At
this
spot
,
so
<UNK>
with
fond
and
filial
remembrances
,
his
heart
beat
almost
to
bursting
,
his
knees
tottered
under
him
,
a
mist
floated
over
his
sight
,
and
had
he
not
clung
for
support
to
<NUMBER>
of
the
trees
,
he
would
inevitably
have
fallen
to
the
ground
and
been
crushed
beneath
the
many
<UNK>
continually
passing
there
.
Then
he
advanced
to
the
door
,
and
asked
whether
there
were
any
rooms
to
be
let
.
The
bed
belonging
to
the
present
occupants
was
placed
as
the
former
owner
of
the
chamber
had
been
accustomed
to
have
his

and
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
prevent
it
,
the
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
suffused
in
tears
as
he
reflected
that
on
that
spot
the
old
man
had
breathed
his
last
,
vainly
calling
for
his
son
.
Having
obtained
the
address
of
the
person
to
whom
the
house
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
belonged
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
next
proceeded
thither
,
and
,
under
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-LRB-
the
name
and
title
inscribed
on
his
passport
-RRB-
,
purchased
the
small
dwelling
for
the
sum
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
,
at
least
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
more
than
it
was
worth
;
but
had
its
owner
asked
half
a
<NUMBER>
,
it
would
unhesitatingly
have
been
given
.
But
on
the
following
day
the
family
from
whom
all
these
particulars
had
been
asked
received
a
handsome
present
,
consisting
of
an
entirely
new
fishing-boat
,
with
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
and
a
tender

It
also
boasted
of
what
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
styled
a
garden
,
consisting
of
a
small
plot
of
ground
,
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
main
entrance
reserved
for
the
reception
of
guests
.
Each
<UNK>
served
as
a
perch
for
a
<UNK>
,
which
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
by
through
this
<UNK>
scene
with
its
<UNK>
,
monotonous
note
.
The
inn-keeper
himself
was
a
man
of
from
<NUMBER>
to
<NUMBER>
years
of
age
,
tall
,
strong
,
and
bony
,
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
natives
of
those
southern
latitudes
;
he
had
dark
,
sparkling
,
and
deep-set
eyes
,
hooked
nose
,
and
teeth
white
as
those
of
a
<UNK>
animal
;
his
hair
,
like
his
beard
,
which
he
wore
under
his
chin
,
was
thick
and
<UNK>
,
and
in
spite
of
his
age
but
slightly
<UNK>
with
a
few
silvery
threads
.
<UNK>
in
the
neighborhood
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
had
shared
in
the
beauty
for
which
its
women
are
proverbial
;
but
that
beauty
had
gradually
withered
beneath
the
<UNK>
influence
of
the
slow
fever
so
prevalent
among
<UNK>
by
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
marshes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Still
,
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
amid
this
affected
resignation
to
the
will
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
unfortunate
inn-keeper
did
not
<UNK>
under
the
double
misery
of
seeing
the
hateful
canal
carry
off
his
customers
and
his
profits
,
and
the
daily
<UNK>
of
his
<UNK>
partner
's
murmurs
and
lamentations
.
But
,
by
degrees
,
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
embroidered
<UNK>
,
velvet
<UNK>
,
elegantly
worked
stockings
,
striped
<UNK>
,
and
silver
buckles
for
the
shoes
,
all
disappeared
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
unable
to
appear
abroad
in
his
<UNK>
splendor
,
had
given
up
any
further
participation
in
the

and
<UNK>

both
for
himself
and
wife
,
although
a
bitter
feeling
of
envious
discontent
filled
his
mind
as
the
sound
of
mirth
and
merry
music
from
the
joyous
<UNK>
reached
even
the
miserable
hostelry
to
which
he
still
clung
,
more
for
the
shelter
than
the
profit
it
afforded
.
Nevertheless
,
had
<PROPER_NOUN>
but
retained
his
post
a
few
minutes
longer
,
he
might
have
caught
a
dim
outline
of
something
approaching
from
the
direction
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
as
the
moving
object
drew
nearer
,
he
would
easily
have
perceived
that
it
consisted
of
a
man
and
horse
,
between
whom
the
<UNK>
and
most
amiable
understanding
appeared
to
exist
.
However
that
might
have
been
,
the
priest
,
dismounting
,
led
his
steed
by
the
bridle
in
search
of
some
place
to
which
he
could
secure
him
.
``
You
are
welcome
,
sir
,
most
welcome
!
''
-
he
only
barks
,
he
never
bites
.
What
would
the
abbe
please
to
have
?
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
host
,
even
more
surprised
at
the
question
than
he
had
been
by
the
silence
which
had
preceded
it
;
``
I
am
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
your
service
.
''
``
I
did
.
''
But
talking
of
heat
,
is
there
nothing
I
can
offer
you
by
way
of
refreshment
?
''
``
Are
you
quite
alone
?
''
said
the
priest
,
with
a
show
of
interest
,
glancing
round
as
he
spoke
at
the
<UNK>
furnishings
of
the
apartment
.
``
So
much
the
better
for
you
,
if
what
you
assert
be
true
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``
for
I
am
firmly
persuaded
that
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
good
will
be
rewarded

and
the

punished
.
''
inquired
Caderousse
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
``
You
remind
me
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
that

concerning

I
asked
you
was
said
to
bear

Did
you
know
him
?
A
deadly
pallor
followed
the
flush
on
the
countenance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
turned
away
,
and
the
priest
saw
him
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
with
the
corner
of
the
red
handkerchief
twisted
round
his
head
.
Ah
,

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
speaking
in
the
highly
colored
language
of
the
south
,
``
the

grows
worse

<PROPER_NOUN>
wiped
away
the
large
<UNK>
of
perspiration
that
gathered
on
his
brow
.
Ah

the

told
you

Instead
of
employing
this
diamond
in
attempting
to

his

who
might
only
have
taken
it
and
then
betrayed
him

carefully
preserved

``

replied
the

continued
the

without
seeming
to
notice
the
emotion

the

``
True

the

,
making
a
strong
effort
to
appear
indifferent
;

from

about

after

asked
the
priest

anxiously
and
eagerly
.
``
Why

a

from

``
This

Nothing

Again
the

had
been

to
swallow
a
draught
of
water
to
calm
the
emotions

threatened
to
overpower
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
no

irritated

the

in

in

voice
.
``

answered
the

calmly
,
as
he
replaced
the
jewel
and
its

in
the
pocket

his
cassock
,

the

For

<PROPER_NOUN>
then
entered
her

the

creaked
beneath

proceeded
towards

fell
as

exhausted

With

he
went
stealthily
to
the
door

he
closed
,

,
by
way
of
still
greater

bolted

barred
it

he

praying

the

reached

begged

The

closed

I
looked
through

saw
him
so
pale

haggard
,
that
believing

very
ill

I
went
and
told

then
ran
on

The

uttered
a

came
again

He
proposed

<PROPER_NOUN>
agreed

deserted

inquired
the

with
an
ironical

<PROPER_NOUN>

she
wished
for

it
seemed
as

At
this

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
burst
into
a

reminded

The

he
was

The

to
reflect
a

Everything
was
here
arranged
in
perfect
order

each

had
its

each

its

He
folded
up
the
accusation
quietly
,
and
put
it
as
quietly
in
his
pocket
;
read
the
examination

saw

Out
of
all
the
numerous
clerks
that
used
to
fill
the
deserted
corridor

the

remained

In

of

the

was
the
only

unmoved

Everything
was
as

said

a
question
of
arithmetic
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
during

years
he
had
always

all

made
with

that
it

it

In

he

fearing

<UNK>
abroad
at

fair
to
sell
his

jewels

a

Such

the

the

conduct

the

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
closed
the

arose

offered

resumed

passed

was
covered

added

<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
and
advanced
to
the
door

his

failed
him
and
he
sank
into

A

Why
I
think

We

blessed

<PROPER_NOUN>

again
turning

<PROPER_NOUN>
gratefully

Yes

And
he
glanced
towards
the
clerk
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
&
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
remained
motionless
in
the
corner
during

the

returned
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
reflected

``
Oh

<PROPER_NOUN>
;

I

''
The
stranger
met
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
stairs
;
she
pretended
to
be
descending
,
but
in
reality
she
was
waiting
for
him
.
``
Yes
,
sir

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

mademoiselle

In

court
he
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
with
a
<UNK>
of
a
<NUMBER>
francs
in
either
hand
,
seemed
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
retain
them
.
Unfortunately
,
however
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
only
engagements
with
the
house
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
&
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
shown
themselves
so
<UNK>
towards
him
;
and
,
as
he
had
said
,
in
business
he
had
correspondents
,
and
not
friends
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
thus
remained
in
his
accustomed
tranquillity
.
Still
confidence
was
not
restored
to
all
minds
,
and
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
complete
ruin
of
the
unfortunate
shipowner
had
been
postponed
only
until
the
end
of
the
month
.
Fortunately
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
some
funds
coming
in
on
which
he
could
rely
;
and
,
as
they
reached
him
,
he
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
meet
his
engagements
when
the
end
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
.
He
delayed
presenting
himself
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
but
the
owner
,
hearing
of
his
arrival

went
to
see
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
,
it
would
seem
,
made
good
use
of
his
money
,
for
he
was
newly
clad
.
``
<UNK>
fellows
!
''
But
,
contrary
to
all
expectation
,
when
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
,
the
house
opened
as
usual
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
behind
the
grating
of
the
counter
,
examined
all
bills
presented
with
the
usual
scrutiny
,
and
,
from
first
to
last
,
paid
all
with
the
usual
precision
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
thought
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
now
immensely
rich
,
and
had
<UNK>
under
great
obligations
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
former
days
,
since
to
him
it
was
owing
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
the
service
of
the
Spanish
banker
,
with
whom
he
had
laid
the
<UNK>
of
his
vast
wealth
.
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
right
,
for
he
returned
home
crushed
by
the
humiliation
of
a
refusal
.
It
was
agreed
in
a
brief
council
held
among
them
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
should
write
to
her
brother
,
who
was
in
garrison
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
come
to
them
as
speedily
as
possible

At
the
time
when
he
decided
on
his
profession
his
father
had
no
desire
to
choose
for
him
,
but
had
consulted
young
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
taste
.
We
need
hardly
say
that
many
of
those
who
gave
him
this
epithet
repeated
it
because
they
had
heard
it
,
and
did
not
even
know
what
it
meant
.
Who
could
ever
have
believed
it
!
''
He
had
not
even
the
means
for
making
a
possible
settlement
on
account
.
As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
seemed
completely
bewildered
.
Night
came
,
the
<NUMBER>
women
had
watched
,
hoping
that
when
he
left
his
room
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
come
to
them
,
but
they
heard
him
pass
before
their
door
,
and
trying
to
conceal
the
noise
of
his
footsteps
.
The
young
lady
went
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
terrible
idea
that
he
was
writing
his
will
flashed
across
her
;
she
shuddered
,
and
yet
had
not
strength
to
utter
a
word
.
On
the
evening
of
the
4th
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
his
daughter
for
the
key
of
his
study
.
``
What
have
I
done
wrong
,
father
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
should
take
this
key
from
me
?
''
And
she
went
out
,
but
instead
of
going
to
her
apartment
she
hastened
to
consult
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
<NUMBER>
o'clock
when
he
threw
himself
on
the
bed
.
He
was
calm
;
but
the
agitation
of
the
night
was
<UNK>
in
his
pale
and
careworn
visage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
request
,
was
following
her
father
when
he
quitted
the
room
,
but
he
said
to
her
quickly
,
-
``
Remain
with
your
mother
,
dearest
.
''
She
remained
at
the
same
spot
standing
mute
and
motionless
.
she
cried
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
a
sign
to
the
young
man
,
``
go
and
tell
your
father
that
<PROPER_NOUN>

just
arrived

''
``
Yes

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
hesitation
;
``
what
is
your
pleasure
?
``
It
concerns
the
best
interests
of
your
father
,
''
said
the
messenger
.
You
promised
to
obey
me
implicitly
.
She
cast
her
eyes
again
over
the
note
to
<UNK>
it
a
second
time
,
and
saw
there
was
a
postscript
.
Was
there
nothing
to
fear
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
hesitated
,
and
resolved
to
take
counsel
.
``
Go
there
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
said
the
young
girl
with
hesitation
,
``
it
is
your
opinion
that
I
should
obey
this
invitation

''
she
asked
.
``
To-day
,
then

at
eleven

``
Why

if
to-day

The
young
man
knew
quite
well
that

after
the
succession
of
misfortunes
which
had
befallen
his
father
,
great
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
style
of
living
and
<UNK>
;
but
he
did
not
know
that
matters
had
reached
such
a
point
.
Instead
of
going
direct
to
his
study
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
returned
to
his
bed-chamber
,
which
he
was
only
this
moment
quitting
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
he
exclaimed
,
turning
pale
as
death

``

going
to
do
with
that

of
pistols
under

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
looking
fixedly
at
his

``

In

<PROPER_NOUN>

What

he
add
to
such
a
desperate
proof
in

?
``
You

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
in

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
caught
his

It
was
round

completely
encircled
it
.
There
was
a

gave

<PROPER_NOUN>
abandoned

he

He
then
said
something
in

to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
made
a
sign
of
obedience
and
withdrew
,

not
to
any

At

the

touched
the

without

he
entered

The

the

his

yielded

at

,
weary

<UNK>
his

he
gave

and
sank
back
breathless

exhausted
beneath

The

had
fled
;
and
as

had
been

shadows
from

,
they
had
vanished
at

There
for
some

he
enjoyed
the
fresh

which
played
on
his
brow
,
and
listened
to
the
dash
of
the
waves
on

beach
,
that
left
against
the
rocks
a

of
foam
as
white
as
silver

Thus
every

he
saw

<NUMBER>

At

the

was
standing
up
looking
towards

holding

He
recognized
the
place
where

had
<UNK>
by

that
was
there
;
but
it
was
in

carried

all
round

At

he
gave

<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled

He
took

,

began

hunt
over

is
fulfilling

,
rather

enjoying

;
and
at

a
quarter

he
had
killed

.
Then
,
in

the
failure

,
he
began
a

``

At

the
boat
began
her
course
they
lost

yacht
,
as
it
disappeared
in

He
set
out

on

reached

At

reached

The

At

The

Through

arrived

paused

And
I
replied
,
``

At
these

he
drew

towards

`
Well

the

the

replied
the

with

to

he

cast

When

had
assured

turned

He
would

no

have
believed
that

had
returned
to

and
would

Vampa
in

resembled

-
`
Oh

'
-
`
Then
take
my
arm
,
and
let
us
on
;
we
have
no
time
to
lose

'
At
the
end
of
this
time
they
had
reached
the
thickest
of
the
forest
.
Suddenly
,
about
<NUMBER>
paces
from
them

a

advanced
from

aimed

the
sentinel
;

Then
the
bandit
thrice
imitated
the
cry

a
<UNK>

a
<UNK>
answered
this
signal
.
The
retreat

inquired

cried
several

from

who

A

The

to
his

As

heard

arose

The
side
windows

hung
with
yellow
damask

the

<NUMBER>
with
white
damask

a
red
cross

The

could
not

the

The

let

<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
the
words

imperfectly
,
and
he
perhaps
did
not
fully
appreciate
this

was
wholly
absorbed
by
the

presented
,
and
by
the
terrible

in

Their
repast
consisted
apparently
of
bread
and
sausages

The

transported
the

from

<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
little

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

had

in
a

closed

before
which

<NUMBER>
sentinels

relieved

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
seemed

spectators

the
balconies

churches

the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
<UNK>
;
the
steps
even
seemed
a
<UNK>
sea
,
that
was
impelled
towards
the
portico
;
every
niche
in
the
wall
held
its
living
statue
.
Suddenly
the
tumult
ceased
,
as
if
by
magic
,
and
the
doors
of
the
church
opened
.
This

was
the
executioner
.
Neither
had
his

bandaged

At
this

alone
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt

And
yet
his

wore
an

such

had
never

witnessed

his

full

In

suffered

grow
;
his

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
reached

a

arrived
in

forced
his

through

advancing

Do

But

created

However

the

still
continued
,
and
it
was
dreadful
to
witness
.
``
What

you

was
only
guilty

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
fascinated
by
the
horribly
spectacle
.
The
executioner
let
fall
his
<UNK>

drew
his

,
and
with
<NUMBER>
stroke
opened
his

and
mounting

stamped
violently

The

was
erect

triumphant

like

``
Well

The

fairly

,
and
the
recollection

seen
half
an

was
gradually
effaced
from

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
up
-
they
were
opposite

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

We
have
forgotten
to

,
that
the

was
attired
in

with

with

at

``
Ah

said
he
to

;

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mask
fell
off

<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
it
in

the

went
triumphantly
on

returned

laughing

Perhaps

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
right
;
the
fair
unknown
had
resolved
,
doubtless
,
to
carry
the
intrigue
no
farther
;
for
although
the
young

made
several
more
turns
,
they
did
not
again
see
the

had
turned

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
opposite

;
the
coachman
,
without
saying
a

,
drove
up
it
,
passed
along
the

di
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

<PROPER_NOUN>

stopped
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
great

to
put

instead

he
inquired

could
procure

a

``

He
was
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
all

.
They
told
him
so
frankly

he
received

with
the

who
appreciated

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fastened
the

The

was
as

as
the

<NUMBER>

perhaps
even
more
animated
and
noisy

the

appeared
for

at

At

he

<UNK>
as

by

The

had
<UNK>
her

as

passed
she
raised

He
had
made
up
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
attributed

After
dinner
,
the
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
announced
.
He
was
charming
.
On
his
side
,
however
great
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
desire
was
to
allude
to
their
former
interview
,
the
fear
of
being
disagreeable
to
the
man
who
had
loaded
him
and
his

with
kindness
prevented
him
from
mentioning
it

This
assurance
determined
the
<NUMBER>
friends
to
accept
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
,
we
will
not

see
him
,
but

him
without
imagining
his
stern
head
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>

shoulders
,
or
beneath
<PROPER_NOUN>

<UNK>
.
And
,
to
complete
his
resemblance
with
the
fantastic
heroes
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
poet
,
the
count
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
fascination
.
And
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
be
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
the
count
was
there
.
They
promised
,
upon
separating

to
meet
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
ball
,
to
which
all
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
invited

On
<PROPER_NOUN>

all
those

through

money

time

have
not
been

in
the
gayety
,
and
<UNK>
to
the
noise
and
excitement

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
triumphant
in
his
harlequin
costume
.
There
was
not
on
the
pavement
,
in
the
carriages
,
at
the
windows
,
a
single
tongue
that
was
silent
,
a
single
arm
that
did
not
move
.
At
the
sound
of
the
fireworks
the
carriages
instantly
broke
ranks
,
and
retired
by
the
adjacent
streets
.
When
the
detachment
arrived
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
second
volley
of
fireworks
was
discharged
,
to
announce
that
the
street
was
clear
.
A
new
source
of
noise
and
movement
was
added
to
the
crowd
.
But
he
has
discovered
a
<NUMBER>
means
of
taking
it
away
,
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
somewhat
aided
him
.
Every
<NUMBER>
hastened
to
purchase
moccoletti
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
among
the
rest
.
At
the
end
of
<NUMBER>
minutes
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
lights
glittered
,
descending
from

<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
<PROPER_NOUN>
with

and
saw
him
mount
the
first
step
.
Suddenly
the
bell
that
gives
the
signal
for
the
end
of
the
<UNK>
sounded
,
and
at
the

all
the
moccoletti
were
extinguished
as

The

over

The

was
short

at

of
<NUMBER>
minutes
his

stopped
before

He
therefore
dined
very

in

attention

who
presented
himself
<NUMBER>

<PROPER_NOUN>
dressed

<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
a

run
through

veins
at
observing
that
the
feeling

so

gave

the

evening

I
concluded

was
going

and
I
was
not
deceived
.
This
time
I
did
not
content
myself
with
looking
,
but
I
took
my
knife
out
of
my
pocket
,
felt
that
the
point
was
sharp
,
and
sprang
over
the
wall
.
In
order
to
go
from

<PROPER_NOUN>

<NUMBER>
hours
passed
thus
,
during

I
imagined
I
heard

repeatedly
.
The

moment
had
come
,
but
I
had
so
long
been
prepared
for
it
that
my
heart
did
not
fail
in

.
When
he
was
only
a
few
paces
from
me
,
I
saw
that
what
I
had
taken
for
a
weapon
was
only
a
spade
.
Then
an
idea
crossed
my
mind
,
which
was
confirmed
when
I
saw
the
procureur
lift
from
under
his
mantle
a
box
,
<NUMBER>
feet
long
,
and
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
inches
deep
.
In

I
had
disinterred
the
box
;
then
,
that
it
might
not
be
known
I
had
done
so
,
I
filled
up
the
hole
,
threw
the
spade
over
the
wall
,
and
rushed
through
the
door
,
which
I
double-locked
,
carrying
off
the
key
.
''
``
It
was
not
money

''
Its

visage
,
and
its
violet-colored
hands
showed
that
it
had
perished
from
<UNK>
,
but
as
it
was
not

cold
,
I
hesitated
to
throw
it
into
the
water
that
ran
at
my
feet
.
``
And
what

do
with

''
As
I
passed
the
city
gates
I
declared
that
I
had
found
the
child
on
the
road
,
and
I
inquired
where
the
asylum
was
;
the
box
confirmed
my
statement

proved
that

belonged
to
wealthy

which
I
was
covered
might
have
proceeded
from
the
child
as

In
reply
I
gave
her
the

had
kept
in

reclaim
him

became

uttered

I
had
known
since

caused
by

No

was
raised

and
the

was
given
up
to
her
.

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
maintained

accompanied

with
details

did

triumphed

and
this

rendered
him
so

reflected

The

perfectly
stupefied

I
gave
my

constantly
defended
the
unfortunate

good
advice

and
as
she
confessed
that
she
had
several

missed

a
considerable

I
showed
her
a

to

I
set
off
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

after

fixed
upon

anchored

had

amidst

In
an

we
were
on

alert

it
was
too
late

our

was
surrounded

and
amongst

observed

as
terrified
at
the
sight
of
their
uniforms
as
I
was
brave

sight

I
sprang
into

hold

opened
a
port
,
and
dropped
into
the
river

dived
,
and
only
rose
at
intervals
to
breathe

until
I
reached
a

had

been
made
from

to
the

runs
from

the

`
I
thought

agreed

asked

What

drawing
from

pocket
a

steel

a
small
set
of

he
took

carefully

And
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
gold

held
it
sparkling
before
the
dazzled
eyes

the
innkeeper

in

All

all

I

<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
to
gaze
on
him
for
some
time
,
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
she
took
her

immediately
opposite
to
him
.
The
woman
's
lips
seemed
to
move
,
as
though
she
were
talking

but
because
she
merely
spoke
in
an

my

were
<UNK>
by

I
did
not
catch
a

she
uttered
.
I
had
not

fully
recovered
consciousness
,
when
again
I
heard
groans
,
mingled
with
<UNK>
cries
,
as
if
from

engaged

.
The
staircase
creaked
,
he
descended
into
the
room
below
,
approached
the
fire
and
lit
a
candle
.
After
this
he
took
from
his
cupboard
the
bank-notes
and
gold
he
had
put
there
,
thrust
the
<NUMBER>

the

into

hastily
tied
up
a

bundle
of
linen
,
and
rushing
towards
the
door
,
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
The
poorly
fastened
boards
which
alone
divided
me
from
it
yielded
to
my
efforts
,
and
I
found
myself
in
the
house
.
The
shot
had
frightfully
<UNK>
her
throat
,
leaving
<NUMBER>
gaping
wounds
from
which
,
as

the

was
pouring
in

.
The

lay
on

his

leaning

and
about

there

I

towards

clutching

uttering
a

of
horror
.
When
I
strove
to
speak
,
a

inarticulate
sounds
alone
escaped
my

asked
a
gendarme

I
recovered
force
and
energy
enough
to
free
myself
from

hands
of
those

held

while
I
managed
to
<UNK>
forth

I
was
utterly
overpowered
by

without

I
suffered

thus
they
took

<NUMBER>

passed

When

the
indication

be
observed
in

Terror
seemed

deprived

All

made
no

from
the
first

saw

had
made
so

an

His

was
large

and
the

which

regained
their

were
particularly
thin
;
in

the
deep

giving

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

wiped

darted

galloped

already

He
spoke
in

The

From

to

hung
a

while

a

endeavoring

the

come

Oh

<PROPER_NOUN>

That

to

nothing

the

I

A
faint
cry
of
mingled
pleasure
and
surprise
escaped
from
the
lips
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
almost
instantly
said
,
in
a
<UNK>
tone
,
as
though
some
envious
cloud
darkened
the

illumined
her

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

as

Is

I
have
been

For
I

no

harassed

persecuted

in

the

my

beats
fast

the

burns
in

I
can
hardly
breathe

I
solemnly

What

You

A
rapid
change
took
place
in
the
young

feelings
.
The
general
remark
is
,
`
Oh

it

replied
the

,
``

walked

she
seated

through

by

that

come

In

his

produced
on
the
mind
the
impression

with
living
eyes

nothing
could
be
more
startling
than
to
observe
the

suddenly
lighting

united
with

<UNK>
by

rendered

its

As
we
have
said

he
perfectly
understood
the

and
if

did
not
use

it
was

indifference

which
prevented
him
from
so
doing

continued
the

seemed
at

she
passed
over
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
bottle
full
of
the

red
liquid
whose
good
properties
the

on

looked
for

but
,
as
he
was
not
especially
interested
in
poetical
ideas
,
he
had
gone
into
the
garden
,
and
was
talking
with
Major
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
projected
railway
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Oh
,
no

she
answered
;

He
then
took
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
arm
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
holding
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
under
his
own
,
he
dragged
the
procureur
to
the
<UNK>
,
where
the
shade
was
thickest
.
``
A
newly
born
infant

repeated
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
this
affair
becomes
serious
!

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
last
effort
.
``
And
pray
what
do

call
such
an
action

``
What

done

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
that
the
<NUMBER>
persons
for
whom
he
had
prepared
this
scene
could
scarcely
endure
it
,
and
not
wishing
to
carry
it
too
far
,
said
,
``
Come
,
gentlemen
,
-
some
coffee

we
seem
to
have

and
he
conducted
the
guests
back
to
the
table
on
the
lawn
.
But
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
reach
her
friend
the
procureur
had
found
time
to
whisper
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
must
speak
to
you

``
In

The
evening
passed
on
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
expressed
a
desire
to
return
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
dared
to
do
,
notwithstanding
the
uneasiness
she
experienced
.
While
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
begged
the
smelling-bottle
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
noticed
the
approach
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
he
soon
guessed
all
that
had
passed
between
them
,
though
the
words
had
been
uttered
in
so
low
a
voice
as
hardly
to
be
heard
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
spoken
very
little
during
dinner
;
he
was
an
intelligent
lad
,
and
he
feared
to
utter
some
<UNK>
before
so
many
grand
people
,
amongst
whom
,
with
<UNK>
eyes
,
he
saw
the
king

attorney
.
<NUMBER>
thing
above
all
the
rest
heightened
the
respect
,
nay
almost
the
veneration
,
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
And
I
,
sir
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
shall
be
most
happy
to
receive
you

''
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
began
,
by
way
of
showing
off
,
to
scold
his
groom
,
who
,
instead
of
bringing
the
tilbury
to
the
steps
of
the
house
,
had
taken
it
to
the
outer
door
,
thus
giving
him
the
trouble
of
walking
<NUMBER>
steps
to
reach
it
.
But
instead
of
either
of
these
,
he
saw
nothing
but
a
strange
face
,
<UNK>
,
and
encircled
by
a
beard
,
with
eyes
brilliant
as
<UNK>
,
and
a
smile
upon
the
mouth
which
displayed
a
perfect
set
of
white
teeth
,
pointed
and
sharp
as
the
wolf
's
or
<UNK>

.
``
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
''
``
I
am
not
begging
,
my
fine

,
''
said
the
unknown
to
the
servant
,
with
so
ironical
an
expression
of
the
eye
,
and
so
frightful
a
smile
,
that
he
withdrew
;
``
I
only
wish
to
say
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>

gave
me
a

about
a

I

stand

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
pale
,
but
said
nothing
.
``
Let
me
at
least
reach
a
shady
spot
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
a
pity
this
scene
had
not
occurred
in
daylight
,
for
it
was
curious
to
see
this
rascal
throwing
himself
heavily
down
on
the
cushion
beside
the
young
and
elegant
driver
of
the
tilbury
.
``
How
have
I
deceived
you

''
``
It
does
not

on

afraid

added
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
his
unpleasant
smile
.
This
menace
smothered
the
young
man

passion

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
eyes
sparkling
with
avarice

have
<NUMBER>
coats

will
give
me

Is
it
as
good
now

``
A

and
a

But

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
again
smiling
with
the
disagreeable
expression
he
had
before
assumed
,
``
you
must
pay
for
it
-

understand

''
``
Come
-

understand

with

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
By

But
tell
me
all
about
it
?

do
you
again
defy

''
``
Yes

so
long
as

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
who

``
Not

Then
,
to
justify
myself
,
I
should
say
that
you
gave
me
the
money
;
this
would
cause
inquiries
,
it
would
be
found
that
I
left
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
giving
due
notice
,
and
I
should
then
be
escorted
back
to
the
shores
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Certainly
,
as
he
had
himself
owned
,
the
<UNK>
son
of
Major
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
wilful
fellow
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
hand
left
his
pocket
<UNK>
,
and
was
carried
up
to
the
red
mustache
,
which
it
played
with
for
some
time
.
But
how
will
you
pass
through
the
barrier
without
exciting
suspicion
?
``
But

tell
me
,

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
am
I
to
remain

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

At
the
first
cross
street
<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
his
horse

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
leaped
out
.
``
But
what
am
I
to
do

``
Alas

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
sighing
,
``

can
not
be

happy

When
he
reached
the
wicket
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
turned
to
the
left
,
galloped
across
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
passed
through
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
,
issuing
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
la
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
arrived
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

door
just
at
the
same
time
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<UNK>
,
after
having
deposited
him

his
wife
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

stopped
to
leave
the
baroness
at
her
own
house
.
``
Because

spirits
all

said
the
baroness
.

You

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

``

``
My

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
through
the
door

<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
.
Then
she
began
thoughtfully
to
caress
the
little
<UNK>
.
And
yet
,
as
she
could
scarcely
breathe
,
she
rose
and
went
towards
a
looking-glass
.
At
the
noise
of
the
door
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
round
,
and
looked
upon
her
husband
with
an
astonishment
she
took
no
trouble
to
conceal
.
``
Read
me
something

<PROPER_NOUN>

she
said
.
The
baroness
was
also
surprised
,
and
showed
her
astonishment
by
a
look
which
would
doubtless
have
had
some
effect
upon
her
husband
if
he
had
not
been
intently
occupied
with
the
paper
,
where
he
was
looking
to
see
the
closing
stock

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
muttered
something
,
bowed
and
went
out
,
knocking
himself
against
the
edge
of
the
door
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
in

''
``
Do
you
know

asked
the
baroness

These
glances
frequently
exasperated
the
pride

this
evening
he
took
no
notice
of
them
.
``
Not
so

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

I
do
not

the

trying
to
disguise
the
agitation

the
flush
of
her
face
.
``
Is
it

The

The

for

drove
to

inscribed
his

While
the

was
waiting
in

,
the
door
opened
,
and
a
man
dressed
as
an

more
familiar

came
in

instead

merely
bowed

passed
on

disappeared

the
house
had
not
been
inhabited

There
all
the
thoughts
which
had
disturbed
me

constant
agony
came
back
with
double
force

It
was
therefore
necessary
,
before
everything

and
at
all
risks
,
that
I
should
cause
all
traces
of
the

to
disappear
-
that
I
should
destroy
every
material
vestige
;
too
much
reality
would
always
remain
in
my
recollection
.
I
seemed
everywhere
to
hear
your
moans
behind
me
in
the
bed
,
and
I
dared
not
turn
around
.
``
Listen
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
I
consider
myself
as
brave
as
most

but
when
I
drew
from
my

the
little
key
of
the
staircase
,
which
I
had
found
in
my
coat
-
that
little
key
we
both
used
to
cherish
so
much
,
which
you
wished
to
have
fastened
to
a

ring
-
when
I
opened
the
door
,
and
saw
the
pale
moon
shedding
a
long
stream
of
white
light
on
the
spiral
staircase
like
a
spectre
,
I
leaned
against
the
wall
,
and
nearly
shrieked
.
I
grasped
the
<UNK>

if
I
had
relaxed
my

I
should
have
fallen

In
the
middle
of
the
lawn
I
stopped
to
light
it

then
I
continued
my
path

I
examined
the
thicket
with
my
dark
lantern
;
it
was
empty

Still
<NUMBER>
place
where
the
grass
was
thin
attracted
my
attention

it
evidently
was
there

had
turned
up
the

But
no

I
found
nothing
,
though
I
had
made
a
hole
twice
as
large
as
the
first

I
recollected
that
I
was
stabbed
just
as
I
was
trampling
the
ground
to
fill
up
the
hole
;
while
doing
so
I
had
leaned
against
a
<UNK>
;
behind
me
was
an
artificial
<UNK>
,
intended
to
serve
as
a
resting-place
for
persons
walking
in
the
garden
;
in
falling
,
my
hand
,
<UNK>
its
hold
of
the
<UNK>
,
felt
the
coldness
of
the
stone
.
``
The
chest
no

there

''
I
thought
the
assassin
,
having
discovered
the
chest
,
and
supposing
it
to
be
a
treasure
,
had
intended
carrying
it
off

but
,
perceiving
his
error

had
dug
another
hole
,
and
deposited
it
there
;
but
I
could
find
nothing
.
``
Oh
,
heavens

''
I
had
turned
up
the
earth
over
a
surface
of
more
than
<NUMBER>
feet
square
,
and
a
depth
of
<NUMBER>
feet
.
Supposing
it
had
been
thrown
aside
,
it
would
probably
be
on
the
path
which
led
to
the
little
gate
;
but
this
examination
was
as
useless
as
the
first
,
and
with
a
bursting
heart
I
returned
to
the
thicket
,
which
now
contained
no
hope
for
me

<PROPER_NOUN>

traced

now

fixing

Then
he
pressed

back

<PROPER_NOUN>
pronounced
these

with
perfect
calmness
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
her
large
,
scrutinizing
eyes
,
endeavoring
not
to
let
<PROPER_NOUN>
discover
the
grief
which
struggled
in
her
heart
.
``
Oh
!
''
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
The
young
man
smiled
sorrowfully
.
``
It
can
not
change

unhappy
man
;
you

it
must
not
!
''
``
I
must

Another

threaten

him
,
and
to
fight
with

all
that
would
be
folly

I
have

``

He
drew
near
with
his
sweet
smile
,
and
but
for
his
paleness
one
might
have
thought
him
in
his
usual
happy
mood
.
``
The
moment

leave
me

<PROPER_NOUN>

I

<PROPER_NOUN>
trembled
convulsively
;
she
loosened
her
hold
of
the
gate
,
her
arms
fell
by
her
side
,
and
<NUMBER>
large
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
.

have
done
your
duty

be
at
rest

``

raising
both
her

Is

``
Yes

wait

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
revived
at
these
words
;
``
there
are
so
many
things
which
may
save

If

``
And

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
till
we
meet
again

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
tearing
herself
away
.
The
sound
of
a
kiss
was
heard
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
fled
through
the
avenue
.
It
was
to
this
effect
:
-
<UNK>
,
entreaties
,
prayers
,
have
availed
me
nothing
.
This
evening
,
then
,
at
a
quarter
to
<NUMBER>
at
the
gate
.
I
think
it
is
kept
a
secret
from
grandpapa
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
the
contract
is
to
be
signed
this
evening
.
The
day
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
presented
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
left
her
bed
to
receive
him
,
but
had
been
obliged
to
return
to
it
immediately
after
.
The
young
man
read
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
letter
<NUMBER>
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
What
devotion
does
she
deserve
from
him
for
whom
she
has
sacrificed
everything
!
He
had
arranged
everything
for
her
escape
;
<NUMBER>
ladders
were
hidden
in
the
<UNK>
;
a
cabriolet
was
ordered
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
,
without
a
servant
,
without
lights
;
at
the
turning
of
the
first
street
they
would
light
the
lamps
,
as
it
would
be
foolish
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
police
by
too
many
precautions
.
At
length
the
hour
drew
near
.
Consequently
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
having
left
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
half-past
<NUMBER>
by
his
timepiece
,
entered
the
<UNK>
while
the
clock
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
striking
<NUMBER>
.
The
clock
struck
half-past
<NUMBER>
,
and
still
another
half-hour
was
passed
in
waiting
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
walked
to
and
fro
,
and
gazed
more
and
more
frequently
through
the
opening
.
This
was
already
half
an
hour
past
the
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fixed
.
``
It
is
impossible
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
that
the
signing

should
occupy
so

without

or
had
she
been
discovered
and
stopped
in
her
flight
?
He
dwelt
on
this
idea
for
a
moment
,
then
it
appeared
reality
.
He
was
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
premises
-
had
arrived
there
by
<UNK>
the
wall
.
In
a

he
had
passed
through

and
could
see
the
house
distinctly
.
These
<NUMBER>
windows
were
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room

This
darkness
and
silence
alarmed
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
more
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
absence
had
done
.
If
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
,
he
would
speak

passed
;

was
accompanied

and

still
he
should
see

he
would
listen
to
their
conversation

and
might
understand
something
of
this
hitherto
incomprehensible
mystery
.
Soon
the
<NUMBER>
gentlemen
stopped
also
.
Dead

asked
the

alarmed
.
``
What
are

''
``
Let

sit
down

repeated
he
within
himself
;
and
he
felt
as
if
he
were
also
dying

``
<UNK>

consumed
her

said

had

You

seized

Oh

``
Yes

For

having
tried

movement

I
resolved

''
But
,
doctor
,
you
see
me
already
so
grieved

how
can
I
introduce
into
my

so

scandal

after

Pardon
me

doctor

these

were

you

Let
us
bury
this

secret
in
the

recesses
of
our

;
I
am
willing
,
if
any
<NUMBER>
should
suspect
this

that
my
silence
on

subject
should
be
imputed
to
my
ignorance
.
And
,
as
if
he
feared
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
recall
his
promise
,
he
hurried
him
towards
the
house
.
The
light
had
almost
disappeared
from
the
former
;
doubtless
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
put
out
her
lamp
,
and
the
<UNK>
alone
reflected
its
dull
light
on
the
window
.
It
can
not
be
wondered
at
that
his
mind
,
generally
so
courageous
,
but
now
disturbed
by
the
<NUMBER>
strongest
human
passions
,
love
and
fear
,
was
weakened
even
to
the
indulgence
of
superstitious
thoughts
.
Her
eyes
,
raised
towards
heaven
,
were
watching
a
silvery
cloud
gliding
over
the
azure
,
its
form
that
of
a
shadow
mounting
towards
heaven
.
He
would
at

approach

father
and
acknowledge
all
,
begging
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
pardon

sanction
the
love
which
united

fond

loving
hearts

He
turned
back
,
a
door
partly
open
enabled
him
to
see
his
road
,
and
to
hear
the
voice
of
<NUMBER>
in
sorrow

She
had
turned
from
the
window
,
which
remained
open
,
and
was
praying
in
accents
that
would
have
affected
the
most
<UNK>
;
her
words
were
rapid

incoherent

unintelligible
,
for
the
burning
weight
of
grief
almost
stopped
her
utterance

<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
him
without
betraying
the

surprise
.
Neither
dared
for
some
time
to
speak
in

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a
trembling
voice
,
``

conversing

listened

asked

astonished

seated

cast

looked

Then
turning

with

shaded
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a

more

before

The
note
indicated
neither
the
street
nor
the
number

the
house
where
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
;
it
bore

announced

The

the

told

it

When

were
seated
in

carriage
the

reminded
the
general
of
his
promise
to
allow
his
eyes
to
be
bandaged

to
which
he
made
no

The
general
alighted
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
president
,
of
whose
dignity
he
was
not
aware
,
considering
him
simply
as

club

they
went
through
the
alley
,
mounted
a
flight
of
stairs
,
and
entered
the

.

They
questioned
him
as
to
his
sentiments

but
he
contented
himself
with
answering

that

ought
to
have
informed

<PROPER_NOUN>
interrupted
himself
by
saying

continued
:

`
The

then
sought
to
make

speak
more

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
that
he
wished
first
to
know
what
they
wanted
with
him
.
When
the
reading
was
finished
,
he
remained
silent
,
with
knitted
brows
.
''
This
answer
was
too
clear
to
permit
of
any
mistake
as
to
his
sentiments
.
The
communication
has
been
made
to
you
in
consequence
of
the
confidence
placed
in
you

which
does
you
honor
.
You
see
I
am
more
candid
than
you

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
help
casting
<NUMBER>
glance
towards
the
young

,
whose
filial

it
was
delightful
to
behold

When

you

or
we
should
not
take
so
much
care
to
avoid

police
.
These
words
were
followed
by
a
general
murmur
,
and
it
was
evident
that
several
of
the
members
were
discussing
the
propriety
of
making
the
general
repent
of
his
<UNK>
.
''
The
general
looked
around
him
with
slight
uneasiness
;
however
he
did
not
yield
,
but
calling
up
all
his
fortitude
,
said
,
-
``
I
will
not
swear

''
''
A
significant
silence
followed
these
words
,
and
as
the
general
did
not
reply
,
-
``
Close
the
doors
,
''
said
the
president
to
the
door-keeper
.
''
But
he
does
wrong
to
use
his
privilege
.
The
general
appeared
to
be
affected
by
a
nervous
tremor
,
which
prevented
his
answering
for
some
moments
;
then
,
overcoming
his
manifest
repugnance
,
he
pronounced
the
required
oath
,
but
in
so
low
a
tone
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
to
the
majority
of
the
members

who
insisted
on
his
repeating
it
clearly
and
distinctly
,
which
he
did
.
''
<NUMBER>
of
those

was
the

there

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

lead
down
to

`
``

Now

please

remove
your
bandage

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
interrupted
himself
,
and
wiped
the
cold
drops
from
his
brow
;
there
was
something
awful
in
hearing
the
son
read
aloud
in
trembling
pallor
these
details
of
his
father
's
death
,
which
had
hitherto
been
a
mystery

For
<NUMBER>
days
the
<UNK>
had
been
<NUMBER>

below
freezing
and
the

were
covered
with

The
ground
from

steps
to
the
river
was
covered
with
snow
and
<UNK>
,
the
water
of
the
river
looked
black
and
deep
.
The
witnesses
endeavored
to
insist
,
but
the
president
bade
them
be
silent
.
The
witnesses
thought
he
was
dead
,
but
his
adversary
,
who
knew
he
had
not
struck
him
,
offered
him
the
assistance
of
his
hand
to
rise
.
At

he
fell
again
.
The
president
,
without
answering
,
approached
the
witness
who
held
the
lantern
,
and
raising
his
sleeve
,
showed
him
<NUMBER>
wounds
he
had
received
in
his

;
then
opening
his
coat
,
and
<UNK>
his
waistcoat
,
displayed
his
side
,
pierced
with
a
third
wound
.
He
had
scarcely
arrived
at
the
top
when
he
heard
a
heavy
<UNK>
in
the
water
-
it
was
the
general
's
body
,
which
the
witnesses
had
just
thrown
into
the

after
ascertaining

was
dead

When

finished

this

so

for

opened

escaped

for
the

entered
his

to
stifle
the
little
remaining
life
in
the
heart
of
this

He

not

attained

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
out

the

accepted

When

<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
the
boudoir

to

examining

his

soon
produced
its

and
it

with

that
the
baroness
received
the
count
,
although
she
had
been
a

This

was
accompanied
by
killing
glances
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>

and
by
sighs
launched
in
the

It
was
then
,
especially
while
conversing

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
apparently
absorbed
by
the
charm
of

that

The

resounded

she
fell
on

at

holding

up
towards

,
as

desired

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

But
was
it
my

?
And
throwing
the

on

,
he

on
it
and
extinguished
it

At

my

seized
me
in

and
hurrying
noiselessly
along
numerous

known

she
arrived

my

At

the

began
on

the

penetrated

all
round

cried
he

``
My

howled
aloud

plunged
his

into

and
tore

entire

However

he
remained
standing

clinging
to

my

fell
on

knee
,
and
at

were
thrust

armed

my

disappeared
in

kindled
by

opening

<PROPER_NOUN>
must

Hardly

read

when

entered

This
was
an

Noirtier
looked
the

solicited

He

quickly
went

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
on

she
suddenly
remembered
that
in

she
must
reveal

which
concerned

and
she
said
,
``
At

However

he
would
not
leave
without

seeing

again
the

``

she
,

The

sent

the

was
torn
up

made

left

At

assumed
his

in

with

arose

,
making

bow
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a

did
not

almost
started

of

his

he
turned

resumed
his

perceived

down

A
tremor

suppressed
rage
shook
the

making
a
violent
effort
over

he

asked

laid

at

fixed

presented

informed

entered

met

had
concluded
his

bowed
coldly
to

turned
his
back
upon

obeyed

But
the
easy-chair

was
heard
rolling
along
the
floor

he
soon
made
his
appearance
in

fixed
his

on

looked

bounded

flew
down

almost
knocked

poured

his

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
bathed

making

<UNK>
the

announced

at
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

,
he
turned
so
frightfully
pale
that
every

shuddered

fixed
his

upon

He
stated
his
scruples

the

it

proposed

The

put

listened

<PROPER_NOUN>
started

Meanwhile

the

carelessly
opened
the

been
brought
to

aroused

he
read

The

frowned
imperceptibly
.
I
believe

survived
that

He

The

decided
to

thoughtful

silent

the

`
Is

any

-
`
A

accompanied
by
a

'
Behind
the
door-keeper
walked
a

enveloped
in
a
large
veil
,
which
completely
concealed
her
.
``
Who

But

Her

were

said
the

``
The

suffused

the

A

his

became

The

Each

fell

deprived

from

The

,
indeed
,
just
arrived
,

he
was
in
his

,
and
had
forbidden
that
any

be
admitted
.
``

after

Then
,
turning
towards

Then
he
went
to

his

who
since
the

the
day
before
had
refused

had
kept
her

It

evident
from

growing
weaker

guessed

she
concealed
both

rang
for

she
dressed

in

as
the

had
no

where

scarcely
quitted

recognized

it

was
at

conversing
cheerfully

The

expressed
the

prancing

in

tearing

I

She
was
very
beautiful

her

pallor
had
increased

her
eyes
were
more
brilliant
than
ever

and
her
hands

which
were
generally
white
like

now
more
resembled

to
which

was
adding
a

hue

``
I

said

;

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
pale
,
and
made
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
.
``
Oh

cried
she
,
without
losing
any
of
her
cheerfulness

``

made
a

take
the

The

returned

The

went
out

returned
almost

It
was
indeed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
them
with
equal
solemnity

The
popular
banker
found
that
it
answered
better
than
count
.
He
has
about
him
a
little
of
that
foreign
manner
by
which
French
persons
recognize

at

sight
,
the
Italian

German
nobleman

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
pronounced
these
words
with
so
firm
a

the
color
mounted
to

The
general
depended
much
on

;
he
even
came

She

back
on

the

these

He
rang
so
violently

was
alarmed

``
Ah

the

at

They
never

<PROPER_NOUN>
frequently
inquired
of

on

whom
he
passed
and
at

deeply

the

horse
resumed
the

gallop
it

kept
up
since
leaving

arrived

at

And

after
placing

pieces

francs
each

leaped

stayed
<PROPER_NOUN>
here

it

form

<NUMBER>

after

gave
the
inn-keeper
<NUMBER>
francs
,
and
in
taking

from
his
pocket
dropped
a
visiting
card

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who

stayed
there
in

rides
about

recollected
the

turned

by

reflected
lamp

and
having
dismissed
the

giving

all
the

coin
he

he
began
knocking
at

very

<UNK>

he
had

The

had
no

spoke
with
perfect
composure

had
a
cigar
in

security

These
were
the
reasons
which

added

the
fatigue
,
caused
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
sleep
so
soundly
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
scarcely
opened
his
eyes
when
his
<UNK>
idea
presented
itself

whispered
in
his

that

slept
too

``
Why

there

``
Now

His

like

had

outlet

He
looked
around
and
saw
the
objects
of
his
search
upon
the
chimney-piece
;
they
were
a
pen

ink
,

paper

This
done
,
instead
of
leaving

door
fastened

he
drew
back

bolts
and
even
placed
the
door
ajar

as
though
he
had
left
the
room
,
forgetting
to
close
it

and
slipping
into
the
chimney
like
a
man
accustomed
to
that
kind
of
<UNK>
exercise
,
having
effaced
the
marks
of
his

upon

he
commenced
climbing
the
only
opening
which
afforded
him
the
means
of
escape

<PROPER_NOUN>

that
royal
residence

fortified
town

is
well
furnished

they

began

the

<PROPER_NOUN>

the

hotel

naturally
directed
their

inquiries
there

This
late
arrival
had
attracted
much
suspicion
,
and
the
young
man
being
no
other
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
commissary
and
gendarme
,
who
was
a
brigadier
,
directed
their
steps
towards
his

And
,
indeed
,
the
little
note
and
pin
upon

table
confirmed
,
or
rather
<UNK>
,
the
sad
truth

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
taken
the
precaution
to
leave
no
traces
of
his
feet
in
the
ashes
,
but
still
it
was
an
outlet

in

was
not

be
passed
over
without
serious
investigation

At
<NUMBER>
time
he
thought
he
was
saved

for
he
heard
the
brigadier
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
,
to
the
<NUMBER>
gendarmes
,
``
He
is
not
here

He
looked
around
for
a
chimney
from
which
no
smoke
issued
,
and
having
reached
it
,
he
disappeared
through
the
orifice
without

This
is
what
had

of

resounded
through

from

to
the

leading
to

gallery

ready

rush
out
;
but
he
was
stopped
short
,
and
he
stood
with
his
body
a
little
thrown
back
,
pale
,
and
with
the
useless
knife
in
his
clinched
hand
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
-LRB-
in
a
tone
which
a

The

looked
with
horror
upon
this
shameful
metamorphosis
,
the
man
of
the
world
shaking
off
his
covering
and
appearing
as
a
galley-slave
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
you
need
not
be
ashamed

even
though
you
did
post

The
gate
of
the
hotel
had
been
closed
to
screen
them
from
sight
,
but
they
were
forced
,
when
the
door
was
open
,
to
pass
through
a
throng
of
curious
glances
and
whispering
voices
.
The
next
day
they
stopped
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
baroness
had
looked
forward
to
this
marriage
as
a
means
of
<UNK>
her
of
a
guardianship
which
,
over
a
girl
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
character
,
could
not
fail
to
be
rather
a
troublesome
undertaking
;
for
in
the
tacit
relations
which
maintain
the
bond
of
family
union
,
the
mother
,
to
maintain
her
ascendancy
over
her
daughter
,
must
never
fail
to
be
a
model
of
wisdom
and
a
type
of
perfection
.
At
the
precise
time
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
dressed
in
black
and
concealed
in
a
long
veil
,
was
ascending
the
stairs
leading
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
apartments
,
-
notwithstanding
the
assurances
of
the
concierge
that
the
young
man
was
not
at
home
,
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
occupied
in
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
of
a
friend
,
who
tried
to
persuade
him
that
after
the
terrible
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
he
ought
,
as
a
friend
of
the
family
,
to
marry
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
her
<NUMBER>
millions

At
<NUMBER>
minutes
of
<NUMBER>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
tired
of
waiting
,
returned
home
.
She
listened
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
door
,
and
hearing
no
sound
tried
to
enter
,
but
the
bolts
were
in
place
.
Since
then
the
maid
had
been
below
,
and
like
every
<NUMBER>
else
she
thought
the
young
ladies
were
in
their
own
room
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
went
to
bed
without
a
shadow
of
suspicion
,
and
began
to
<UNK>
over
the
recent
events
.
The
affair
,
as
it
will
be
reported
,
will
cover
us
with
shame
;
for
in
a
society
such
as
ours
satire
<UNK>
a
painful
and
<UNK>
wound
.
This
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
wretch
,
a
robber
,
an
assassin
,
and
yet
his
manners
showed
the
effects
of
a
sort
of
education
,
if
not
a
complete
<NUMBER>
;
he
had
been
presented
to
the
world
with
the
appearance
of
an
immense
fortune
,
supported
by
an
honorable
name
.
The
baroness
then
thought
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
conduct
,
therefore
,
upon
reflection
,
appeared
to
the
baroness
as
if
shaped
for
their
mutual
advantage
.
And
after
this
reasoning
she
slept
easily
.
Some
of
the
apartments
were
closed
within
and
without
;
the
shutters
were
only
opened
to
admit
a
minute
's
air
,
showing
the
<UNK>
face
of
a
footman
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
window
would
be
closed
,
like
a
<UNK>
falling
on
a
sepulchre
,
and
the
neighbors
would
say
to
each
other
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Will
there
be
another
funeral
to-day
at
the
procureur
's
house

``
Do

``

But
enough
of
this

here
is
my

it
to

She
had
not
long
to
wait
;
directly
afterwards
the
door
was
opened
wide
enough
to
admit
her
,
and
when
she
had
passed
through
,
it
was
again
shut

In

court
showing
his
merchandise

was
a
tradesman
who
had
been
admitted
with
the

precautions

``
Forgive

he
said

``

the

``

became

bowed
.

Villefort
seized
the

and
hastily
broke
the
seal

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
from

pale

Indeed

only
the

mingled
with

alone
presented

before

As
she
went
down-stairs
she
gave
the

The

even
in

over

The
nurse

having
placed
the

prepared
by
the
doctor
within
reach

the
patient
,
and
locked
the

was
listening

The
globe
of
the

appeared
of
a
reddish
hue
,
and
the
flame
,
<UNK>
before
it
expired

threw
out
the

in
an
inanimate

have
been
so
often
compared
with
the
convulsions

a

creature
in
its

agonies
.
She
stopped
in
the
doorway
,
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
flickering
of
the
lamp
,
the
only
sound
in
that
deserted
room
,
and
then
advanced
to
the
table
to
see
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
glass
were
empty
.
The
dim
light
,
the
profound
silence
,
and
the
gloomy
thoughts
inspired
by
the
hour
,
and
still
more
by
her
own
conscience

all
combined
to
produce
a
sensation
of
fear
;
the
poisoner
was
terrified
at
the
contemplation
of
her

work

It
was
cold
and
motionless

Just
then
the
lamp
again
<UNK>
;
the
noise
startled
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
shuddered
and
dropped
the
curtain
.
About
this
time
the
nurse
's
cough
was
heard
on
the
stairs
and
the
woman
entered
the
room
with
a
cup
in
her
hand

The
clock
striking

awoke
her

<PROPER_NOUN>
staggered
and
buried
his

in
the
bed
.
She
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
curiously
examining
the
glass
,
which
she
felt
certain
of
having
emptied
during
the
night
.
While
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
like
a
statue

terror

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
his

hidden
in
the
bedclothes
,
saw
nothing
around
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
approached
the
window

that
he
might
the

examine
the
contents
of
the

and
dipping
the
tip
of
his

in

tasted
it

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
overpowered
,
her
eyes
first
flashed
and
then
swam
,
she
staggered
towards
the
door
and
disappeared
.
``
Go
to
the
assistance

he
said
to
the

``
Who

<UNK>
to
custom
,
the
door
was
open
,
and
having
no
occasion
to
ring
he
entered
.
Still
this
extraordinary
silence
appeared
strange
to
him
,
and
he
called
a
second
and
third
time
;
still
no
answer
.
``
How
are
you
,
sir

''
``
Yes

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Is
any

<PROPER_NOUN>

Then
he
pointed
to
the
door
.
In
a
minute
the
young
man
darted
through
several
rooms
,
till
at
length
he
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
.
A
terrible
fear
transfixed
him
.
The
terrible
office
he
had
held
for
<NUMBER>
years
had
succeeded
in
making
him
more
or
less
than
man
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
motionless
;
he
could
not
detach
his
eyes
from
that
disordered
bed
,
and
the
pale
corpse
of
the
young
girl
who
was
lying
on
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
corpse
,
gazed
all
around
the
room
,
then
upon
the
<NUMBER>
men
;
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
,
but
finding
it
impossible
to
give
utterance
to
the
<UNK>
ideas
that
occupied
his
brain
,
he
went
out
,
thrusting
his
hands
through
his
hair
in
such
a
manner
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
a
moment
diverted
from
the
<UNK>
topic
,
exchanged
glances
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
-
``
He
is
mad
!
''
This
could
only
have
been
accomplished
by
means
of
unnatural
strength
supplied
by
powerful
excitement
.
``
See
what
they
have
done
!
''
At
this
moment
the
whole
soul
of
the
old
man
seemed
centred
in
his
eyes
which
became
bloodshot
;
the
veins
of
the
throat
swelled
;
his
cheeks
and
temples
became
purple
,
as
though
he
was
struck
with
<UNK>
;
nothing
was
wanting
to
complete
this
but
the
utterance
of
a
cry
.
Oh
,
you
know
it
,
tell
them
,
tell
them
!
''
At
length
,
happier
than
the
young
man
,
who
sobbed
without
weeping
,
tears
glistened
in
the
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
young
man
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
his
anguish
,
fell
heavily
on
his
knees
before
the
bed
,
which
his
fingers
grasped
with
convulsive
energy
.
At
length
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
most
composed
of
all
,
spoke
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
he
to

``

asked

trembling
at
the

inspired
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
hung
his

d'Avrigny
approached
nearer
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
``
Yes

with
his
eyes
.
But
instead
of
finding
sympathy
in
the
eyes
of
the
doctor
and
his
father
,
he
only
saw
an
expression
as
inflexible
as
that
of

.
I
am
stricken
by
fate
.
``
And
I
say
that

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose

though
lower

tone

lost
none
of
its
terrible

:

exclaimed

in

endeavoring

escape

he
was
taken

exclaimed
the

``

The

eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
door
.
``
Must
I
leave

''
``
No

''
``
Yes

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
young
man
's
arm
,
and
led
him
out
of
the
room
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
attentively
on
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

as

spoke

he
ground
his

grasped

was
something
terrible

witness
the
silent
agony

the
mute
despair

whose
tears
silently
rolled
down
his

But
he
stopped
on

said

A
tear

which
appeared
in

eye

expressed
his
thanks

asked

met
those

no

he
read
some

his

His

The

opened

No

his

he
began
reading
the

which
caused
so
much
uneasiness
in

which
ran
as

extended
his

;
<PROPER_NOUN>
kept

and
merely
<UNK>
a
few
pieces
of
money
.
``
Never

replied
the
steward
.
The
whole
establishment
had
been
changed
;
another
valet
was
engaged
for
himself
,
a
new
servant
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
women
had
entered
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

service
,
-
in

,
everywhere
,
to
the
concierge
and
<UNK>
,
new
faces
were
presented
to
the
different
masters
of
the
house
,
thus
<UNK>
the
division
which
had
always
existed
between
the
members
of
the
same
family
.
But
the
mind
of
the
procureur
was
made
up
;
he
felt
assured
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
guilty
,
and
he
hoped
by
his
skill
in
conducting
this
<UNK>
case
to
flatter
his
self-love
,
which
was
about
the
only
<UNK>
point
left
in
his
frozen
heart
.
Once
only
had
<PROPER_NOUN>
seen
his
father
;
it
was
the
day
after
that
upon
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
paid
his
second
visit
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
the
latter
was
to
learn
his
father
's
name
.
The
eye
of
the
old
man
was
riveted
upon
a
spot
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
scarcely
distinguish
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
to
look
at
the
same
object
,
but
suddenly
his
glance
was
transferred
from
the
wife
to
the
husband
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
had
to
submit
to
the
searching
investigation
of
eyes
,
which
,
while
changing
their
direction
and
even
their
language
,
had
lost
none
of
their
menacing
expression
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
drawn
by
an
irresistible
attraction
,
like
that
of
the
bird
to
the
serpent
,
walked
towards
the
house
.
``
It
is
well
,
sir

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
below
,
-
``
it

The
next
day
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
the
first
sitting
of
the
assizes
.
In
the
<UNK>
beyond
the
chestnut-trees
,
a
<UNK>
was
mounting
up
to
heaven
,
while
pouring
out
her
clear
morning
song
.
The
curtain
was
drawn
,
and
yet
the
image
of
his
father
was
so
vivid
to
his
mind
that
he
addressed
the
closed
window
as
though
it
had
been
open
,
and
as
if
through
the
opening
he
had
beheld
the
menacing
old
man
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
his
study
,
heard
the
successive
noises
which
accompany
the
life
of
a
house
,
-
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
,
the
ringing
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
bell
,
to
summon
the
<UNK>
,
mingled
with
the
first
shouts
of
the
child
,
who
rose
full
of
the
enjoyment
of
his
age
.
``
A
cup
of
chocolate
.
''
She
said
you
would
have
to
speak
a
great
deal
in
the
murder
case
,
and
that
you
should
take
something
to
keep
up
your
strength
;
''
and
the
valet
placed
the
cup
on
the
table
nearest
to
the
sofa
,
which
was
,
like
all
the
rest
,
covered
with
papers
.
He
then
rose
,
and
paced
his
room
with
a
smile
it
would
have
been
terrible
to
witness
.
``
Madame
de
Villefort
wishes
to
remind
you

he
said

The
man
drew
back
and
said
,
``

wish

I
will
go
and
tell

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
sitting
on
an
<UNK>
and
impatiently
turning
over
the
leaves
of
some
newspapers
and
<UNK>
which
young
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
by
way
of
amusing
himself
,
was
tearing
to
pieces
before
his

could
finish
reading
them
.
Why
did
you
not
come
down
to
breakfast

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
that
cold
countenance
,
that
resolute
tone
,
and
the
<UNK>
strange
preliminaries
.
The
child
,
unaccustomed
to
such
treatment
,
arose
,
pale
and
trembling
;
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
his
emotion
were
caused
by
fear
or
passion
.

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
to
the
door
,
which
he
closed
behind
the

,
and
bolted

said
the
magistrate
,
without
any
introduction
,
placing
himself
between
his
wife
and
the
door
.
And
,
in
her
first
paroxysm
of
terror
,
she
had
raised
herself
from
the
sofa
,
in
the
next
,
stronger
very
likely
than
the
other
,
she
fell
down
again
on
the
cushions
.
``
Is

''
``
Ah

''
she
muttered
,
``

this
was
all

She
moved
forward
.

were
struck
with

played

so

Before

afterwards

a
court
of

on
days

The

why
I
have
filled
this
whole
assembly
with
horror
.
``
My
mother
thought
me
dead
;
she
is
not
guilty

Notwithstanding
his
shattered
nerves
,
the
ringing
sensation
in
his
ears
,
and
the
madness
which
turned
his
brain
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
as
he
perceived
her
.
``
Yes

''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
am
asked
for

do
you
wish

``
I

``
What

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
cried
the
president
,
``
do
you
yield
to
an

The
procureur
dropped
his
head
;
his
teeth
chattered
like
those
of
a
man
under
a
violent
attack
of
fever
,
and
yet
he
was
deadly
pale
.
The
whole
assembly
were
dumb
with
astonishment
at
the
revelation
and
confession
which
had
produced
a
catastrophe
so
different
from
that
which
had
been
expected
during
the
last
fortnight
by
the
Parisian
world
.
``
And
moreover
,
it
kills

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
calm
and
more
interesting
than
ever
,
he
left
the
hall
,
escorted
by
gendarmes
,
who
involuntarily
paid
him
some
attention
.
Notwithstanding
the
<UNK>
of
the
crowd
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
it
open
before
him
.
Though
he
had
acknowledged
his
guilt
,
he
was
protected
by
his
grief
.
Every
pulse
beat
with
feverish
excitement
,
every
nerve
was
strained
,
every
vein
swollen
,
and
every
part
of
his
body
seemed
to
suffer
distinctly
from
the
rest
,
thus
<UNK>
his
agony
a
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
still
in
his
heart
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
turning
<UNK>
on
the
cushions
,
felt
something
press
against
him
.
he
exclaimed
,
as
though
a
<UNK>
iron
were
piercing
his
heart
.
An
hour
had
elapsed
since
her
condemnation
;
at
that
moment
,
doubtless
,
she
was
recalling
all
her
crimes
to
her
memory
;
she
was
asking
pardon
for
her
sins
;
perhaps
she
was
even
writing
a
letter
imploring
forgiveness
from
her
virtuous
husband
-
a
forgiveness
she
was
purchasing
with
her
death
!
And
yet
I
have
punished
her
-
I
have
dared
to
tell
her
-
I
have
-
`
<UNK>
and
die
!
'
How
could
I
pronounce
that
word
?
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
dashed
open
the
window
in
front
of
the
carriage
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
repeated
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
approached
his
home
-
``
yes
,
that
woman
must
live
;
she
must
repent
,
and
<UNK>
my

,
the
sole

with
the
exception
of
the
<UNK>
old

of
the

my

The
events
which
have
taken
place
in
my

,
though
they
now
occupy
the
public

,
will
be
forgotten
in

or
if

a

enemies
should
persist
in
remembering
them
,
why
then
I
will
add
them
to
my
list
of
crimes

And
the
procureur
breathed
more
freely
than
he
had
done
for
some
time
.
As
he
passed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
,
he
perceived
<NUMBER>
figures
through
the
half-open
door
;
but
he
experienced
no
curiosity
to
know
who
was
visiting
his
father
:
anxiety
carried
him
on
further
.
``
Not
locked
,
''
he
cried
;
``
that
is
well
.
''
He
rushed
towards
the
door
,
found
it
bolted
,
and
stopped
,
shuddering
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
He
thought
that
voice
more
feeble
than
usual
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
burst
it
open
with
a
violent
blow
.
Speak
!
''
and
she
fell
full
length
on
the
floor
.
he
exclaimed
suddenly
,
``
where
is
my
son
?
``
Where
is
my
son
?
''
A
cold
perspiration
burst
out
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
brow
;
his
legs
trembled
,
and
his
thoughts
flew
about
madly
in
his
brain
like
the
wheels
of
a
disordered
watch
.
To
call
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
must
<UNK>
the
echo
of
that
room
which
now
appeared
like
a
sepulchre
;
to
speak
seemed
like
<UNK>
the
silence
of
the
tomb
.
The
child
did
not
answer
.
Through
the
open
door
was
visible
a
portion
of
the
boudoir
,
containing
an
upright
piano
and
a
blue
satin
couch
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
no
longer
the
civilized
man
;
he
was
a
tiger
hurt
unto
death
,
<UNK>
his
teeth
in
his
wound
.
He
pressed
his
burning
lips
to
the
cheeks
,
but
they
were
icy
cold
and
pale
;
he
felt
the
stiffened
limbs
;
he
pressed
his
hand
upon
the
heart
,
but
it
no
longer
beat
,
-
the
child
was
dead
.
A
good
mother
can
not
depart
without
her
son

''
Until
then
he
had
been
sustained
by
rage
,
by
his
strength
of
mind
,
by
despair
,
by
the
supreme
agony
which
led
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
to
scale
the
heavens
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
defy
the
gods
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
perceiving
the
abbe
,
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
around
,
and
,
perceiving
the
excitement
depicted
on
the
magistrate
's
face
,
the
savage
lustre
of
his
eyes
,
he
understood
that
the
revelation
had
been
made
at
the
assizes
;
but
beyond
this
he
was
ignorant
.
``
Good

``
It

said
the

crossing
his

over
his
broad
chest
;

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seizing
the

by
the
wrist
;
``
then
come
here

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
became
pale
at
this
horrible
sight
;
he
felt
that
he
had
passed
beyond
the
bounds
of
vengeance
,
and
that
he
could
no

say
,
``

and
he
tried
to
follow
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
as
though
in
a
dream
he
was
transfixed
to
the
spot
,
-
his
eyes
glared
as
though
they
were
starting
through
the
sockets
;
he
<UNK>
the
flesh
on
his
chest
until
his
nails
were
stained
with
blood
;
the
veins
of
his
temples
swelled
and
boiled
as
though
they
would
burst
their
narrow
<UNK>
,
and
<UNK>
his
brain
with
living
fire
.
In
his
arms
he
held
the
child
,
whom
no
skill
had
been
able
to
recall
to
life

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
down
the
steps
,
and
advancing
towards
the
spot
designated
beheld
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
encircled
by
his
servants
,
with
a
spade
in
his
hand
,
and
digging
the
earth
with
fury
.
And
then
he
moved
farther
on
,
and
began
again
to
dig
.
``
Oh

he
said
,
``
he
is
mad

``

he
said
with
a
smile
;

The
next

they
indeed
left

accompanied
only
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
paying

a
visit

listened
to

plunged
in
his

state
of
apathy

``
What

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
the
sound
of
the
bell
was
heard
,
the
well-known
signal
given
by
the
porter
that
a
visitor
had
arrived
.
``
To

``

exclaimed
the
young

<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
away
to
conceal
the
confusion
of
his
countenance

``
I
will
undertake

replied
the

``
How

almost

I
carry

returned

``

was
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative

<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
himself
in
the
light
,
so
that
his
master
might
see
him
distinctly
,
and
then
imitating
in
his
intelligent
manner
the
countenance
of
the

man

he
closed
his
eyes
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
in
the
custom

doing
when
saying
``
Yes

<PROPER_NOUN>
settled
himself
in
his
corner
without
uttering
a

The
count
stood
alone
,
and
at
a
sign
from
his
hand
,
the
carriage
went
on
for
a
short
distance
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
only
knows
that

retire

His
look
wandered
over
the
vast
plain
like
that
of
some
genius
of
the
night
;
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow

got
into

the
door
was
closed
on
him

and
the

quickly
disappeared
down
the

in

noise

dust

The

entered

after

her

upon

up

The

departed

a
sad
heart
from

had
left

probably
never

A

could
not
long
indulge
in
that
melancholy
which
can
exist
in

he
continued
,
``
can

The

The
weather
was
magnificent
,
and
the
excursion
a
treat
.
The
solitary
light
burning
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
that
first
sight
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

him
whither

the

his

vanquished

the

touched
his

all
these
were
brought
before

in
vivid

frightful
reality

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
remembered
that
on

on

been
violently
dragged
by

forced

A

waited
at
the
door
to
exhibit
to
visitors
this

curiosity

once
a
scene
of
terror

He
again
beheld
the

vainly
endeavoring

asked

The

turned
around

rendered

closed

said

and
taking
Danglars
by

he
dragged

entered

At

he
found
himself
at
the

of
a

,

he
mechanically
lifted
his

<NUMBER>

Danglars
brightened

A

grated
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a

Since

had
not

at

he

With

he
could
manage

keep
out

To
a
Parisian
accustomed
to
silken

walls
hung
with

,
and
the

itself

He
borrowed

The

the

threw

down

on

did

Near

he
also
placed

played
upon

announcing

``

with

A
short
time
ago
,
while
making
researches
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
my
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
stumbled
by
chance
upon
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
printed
-
as
were
most
of
the
works
of
that
period
,
in
which
<UNK>
could
not
tell
the
truth
without
the
risk
of
a

more
or
less
long
,
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
,
it
is
well
known
,
what
strikes
the
capricious
mind
of
the
poet
is
not
always
what
affects
the
mass
of
readers
.
>
From
the
moment
we
had
no
rest
till
we
could
find
some
trace
in
<UNK>
works
of
these
extraordinary
names
which
had
so
strongly
awakened
our
curiosity
.
The
discovery
of
a
completely
unknown
manuscript
at
a
period
in
which
historical
science
is
carried
to
such
a
high
degree
appeared
almost
miraculous
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
as
the
godfather
is
a
second
father
,
we
beg
the
reader
to
lay
to
our
account
,
and
not
to
that
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
la
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
pleasure
or
the
<UNK>
he
may
experience
.
In
those
times
<UNK>
were
common
,
and
few
days
passed
without
some
city
or
other
<UNK>
in
its
archives
an
event
of
this
kind
.
It
resulted
,
then
,
from
this
habit
that
on
the
said
first
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
,
the
citizens
,
on
hearing
the
<UNK>
,
and
seeing
neither
the
<UNK>
standard
nor
the
livery
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rushed
toward
the
<UNK>
of
the
Jolly
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Too
big
for
a
youth
,
too
small
for
a
grown
man
,
an
experienced
eye
might
have
taken
him
for
a
farmer
's
son
upon
a
journey
had
it
not
been
for
the
long
sword
which
,
<UNK>
from
a
leather
baldric
,
hit
against
the
<UNK>
of
its
owner
as
he
walked
,
and
against
the
rough
side
of
his
steed
when
he
was
on
horseback
.
And
this
feeling
had
been
more
painfully
perceived
by
young
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
for
so
was
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
this
second
<PROPER_NOUN>
named
-
from
his
not
being
able
to
conceal
from
himself
the
ridiculous
appearance
that
such
a
steed
gave
him
,
good
horseman
as
he
was
.
Never
sell
it
;
allow
it
to
die
tranquilly
and
honorably
of
old
age
,
and
if
you
make
a
campaign
with
it
,
take
as
much
care
of
it
as
you
would
of
an
old
servant
.
It
is
by
his
courage
,
please
observe
,
by
his
courage
alone
,
that
a
gentleman
can
make
his
way
nowadays
.
Never
fear
quarrels
,
but
seek
adventures
.
I
have
nothing
to
give
you
,
my
son
,
but
<NUMBER>
crowns
,
my
horse
,
and
the
counsels
you
have
just
heard
.
Sometimes
their
play
<UNK>
into
battles
,
and
in
these
battles
the
king
was
not
always
the
stronger
.
Still
further
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
gains
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
crowns
a
year
;
he
is
therefore
a
great
noble
.
On
leaving
the
paternal
chamber
,
the
young
man
found
his
mother
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
with
the
famous
recipe
of
which
the
counsels
we
have
just
repeated
would
<UNK>
frequent
employment
.
With
such
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
morally
and
<UNK>
an
exact
copy
of
the
hero
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
whom
we
so
happily
compared
him
when
our
duty
of
an
historian
placed
us
under
the
necessity
of
<UNK>
his
portrait
.
But
there
,
as
he
was
alighting
from
his
horse
at
the
gate
of
the
Jolly
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
anyone
-
host
,
waiter
,
or
hostler
-
coming
to
hold
his
stirrup
or
take
his
horse
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
,
though
an
open
window
on
the
ground
floor
,
a
gentleman
,
<UNK>
and
of
good
carriage
,
although
of
rather
a
stern
countenance
,
talking
with
<NUMBER>
persons
who
appeared
to
listen
to
him
with
respect
.
Now
,
as
a
half-smile
was
sufficient
to
awaken
the
<UNK>
of
the
young
man
,
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
this
vociferous
mirth
may
be
easily
imagined
.
This
doublet
and
hose
,
though
new
,
were
<UNK>
,
like
traveling
clothes
for
a
long
time
packed
in
a
portmanteau
.
Full
,
then
,
of
this
conviction
,
he
pulled
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
,
and
endeavoring
to
copy
some
of
the
court
airs
he
had
picked
up
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
among
young
traveling
nobles
,
he
advanced
with
<NUMBER>
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
the
other
resting
on
his
hip
.
``
But
I
am
speaking
to
you
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
him
approach
,
drew
his
sword
a
foot
out
of
the
scabbard
.
``
I
do
not
often
laugh
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
stranger
,
``
as
you
may
perceive
by
the
expression
of
my
countenance
;
but
nevertheless
I
retain
the
privilege
of
laughing
when
I
please
.
''
But
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
of
a
character
to
allow
a
man
to
escape
him
thus
who
had
the
insolence
to
ridicule
him
.
``
Why
,
my
good
fellow
,
you
must
be
mad
!
''
The
stranger
,
then
perceiving
that
the
matter
went
beyond
raillery
,
drew
his
sword
,
saluted
his
adversary
,
and
seriously
placed
himself
on
guard
.
``
Not
before
I
have
killed
you
,
<UNK>
!
''
``
By
my
honor
,
these
Gascons
are
<UNK>
!
The
fight
was
therefore
prolonged
for
some
seconds
;
but
at
length
<PROPER_NOUN>
dropped
his
sword
,
which
was
broken
in
<NUMBER>
pieces
by
the
blow
of
a
stick
.
As
to
the
gentleman
,
he
resumed
his
place
at
the
window
,
and
surveyed
the
crowd
with
a
certain
impatience
,
evidently
annoyed
by
their
remaining
<UNK>
.
asked
the
host
.
``
Indeed
!
''
cried
the
stranger
.
``
Did
he
name
no
one
in
his
passion
?
''
Now
,
my
dear
host
,
while
your
young
man
was
insensible
,
you
did
not
fail
,
I
am
quite
sure
,
to
ascertain
what
that
pocket
contained
.
``
Exactly
as
I
have
the
honor
to
tell
your
Excellency
.
''
murmured
he
,
between
his
teeth
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
he
,
``
could
you
not
contrive
to
get
rid
of
this
frantic
boy
for
me
?
``
His
things
and
his
bag
are
with
him

He
causes
a
disturbance
in
your
hostelry
,
which
respectable
people
can
not
put
up
with

Have
they
not
obeyed
me
?
''
said
the
host
to
himself
.
``
She
will
soon
pass
;
she
is
already
late

But
we
find
it
thus
in
the
manuscript
,
and
we
do
not
choose
to
take
upon
ourselves
to
alter
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
half
stupefied
,
without
his
doublet
,
and
with
his
head
bound
up
in
a
linen
cloth
,
arose
then
,
and
urged
by
the
host
,
began
to
descend
the
stairs
;
but
on
arriving
at
the
kitchen
,
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
his
antagonist
talking
calmly
at
the
step
of
a
heavy
carriage
,
drawn
by
<NUMBER>
large
<PROPER_NOUN>
horses
.
She
was
pale
and
fair
,
with
long
curls
falling
in
profusion
over
her
shoulders
,
had
large
,
blue
,
languishing
eyes
,
rosy
lips
,
and
hands
of
<UNK>
.
``
And
as
to
my
other
instructions
?
''
``
I
-
I
return
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
``
This
insolent
boy
<UNK>
others
,
''
cried
he
;
``
and
I
hope
that
this
time
he
whom
he
ought
to
<UNK>
will
not
escape
him
as
before
.
''
``
Remember
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
the
stranger
lay
his
hand
on
his
sword
,
``
the
least
delay
may
ruin
everything
.
''
``
Pay
him
,
booby
!
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
springing
forward
,
in
his
turn
,
after
the
servant
.
coward
!
''
demanded
the
host
.
It
is
to
be
remembered
that
eleven
crowns
was
just
the
sum
that
remained
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
purse
.
The
young
man
commenced
his
search
for
the
letter
with
the
greatest
patience
,
turning
out
his
pockets
of
all
kinds
over
and
over
again
,
rummaging
and
<UNK>
in
his
valise
,
and
opening
and
<UNK>
his
purse
;
but
when
he
found
that
he
had
come
to
the
conviction
that
the
letter
was
not
to
be
found
,
he
flew
,
for
the
third
time
,
into
such
a
rage
as
was
near
<UNK>
him
a
fresh
<UNK>
of
wine
,
oil
,
and
<UNK>
-
for
upon
seeing
this
hot
-
headed
youth
become
exasperated
and
threaten
to
destroy
everything
in
the
establishment
if
his
letter
were
not
found
,
the
host
seized
a
spit
,
his
wife
a
broom
handle
,
and
the
servants
the
same
sticks
they
had
used
the
day
before
.
Unfortunately
,
there
was
<NUMBER>
circumstance
which
created
a
powerful
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
threat
;
which
was
,
as
we
have
related
,
that
his
sword
had
been
in
his
first
conflict
broken
in
<NUMBER>
,
and
which
he
had
entirely
forgotten
.
``
But
,
after
all
,
''
said
he
,
lowering
the
point
of
his
spit
,
``
where
is
this
letter
?
''
His
threat
completed
the
<UNK>
of
the
host
.
``
Does
the
letter
contain
anything
valuable
?
''
cried
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
reckoned
upon
this
letter
for
making
his
way
at
court
.
``
<UNK>
upon
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
private
treasury
,
''
answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
reckoning
upon
entering
into
the
king
's
service
in
consequence
of
this
recommendation
,
believed
he
could
make
this
somewhat
hazardous
reply
without
telling
of
a
falsehood
.
The
money
is
nothing
;
that
letter
was
everything
.
``
That
letter
is
not
lost
!
''
``
No
,
it
has
been
stolen
from
you
.
''
He
came
down
into
the
kitchen
,
where
your
doublet
was
.
answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
little
convinced
,
as
he
knew
better
than
anyone
else
how
entirely
personal
the
value
of
this
letter
was
,
and
was
nothing
in
it
likely
to
tempt
cupidity
.
``
When
I
informed
him
that
your
lordship
was
the
protege
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
that
you
even
had
a
letter
for
that
illustrious
gentleman
,
he
appeared
to
be
very
much
disturbed
,
and
asked
me
where
that
letter
was
,
and
immediately
came
down
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
knew
your
doublet
was
.
''
Thus
the
dealer
to
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
sold
him
for
the
<NUMBER>
livres
did
not
conceal
from
the
young
man
that
he
only
gave
that
enormous
sum
for
him
on
the
account
of
the
originality
of
his
color
.
Next
he
went
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
have
a
new
blade
put
to
his
sword
,
and
then
returned
toward
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
inquiring
of
the
first
Musketeer
he
met
for
the
situation
of
the
hotel
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
proved
to
be
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
that
is
to
say
,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
chamber
hired
by
D'Artagnan
-
a
circumstance
which
appeared
to
furnish
a
happy
augury
for
the
success
of
his
journey
.
His
insolent
bravery
,
his
still
more
insolent
success
at
a
time
when
blows
poured
down
like
hail
,
had
borne
him
to
the
top
of
that
difficult
ladder
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
he
had
climbed
<NUMBER>
steps
at
a
time
.
Thanks
to
this
double
gift
and
the
spotless
name
that
accompanied
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
admitted
into
the
household
of
the
young
prince
where
he
made
such
good
use
of
his
sword
,
and
was
so
faithful
to
his
motto
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
good
blades
of
his
kingdom

was
accustomed
to
say
that
if

who
was
about

fight

he
would
advise
him
to
choose
as
a

himself
first

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
next
-
or
even
,
perhaps

before
himself

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
these
latter

On
his
part
,
the
cardinal
was
not
behind
the
king
in
this
respect
.
Each
boasted
the
bearing

the
courage
of
his
own
people

He
paraded
his
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
before
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
an
insolent
air
which
made
the
gray

of
his
Eminence
curl
with
<UNK>

Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
praised
to
the
highest
note
by
these

,
who
adored
him

and
who

ruffians
as
they
were

trembled
before
him
like

obedient

and
ready
to
sacrifice

to
wash
out

<UNK>
with
a
rare
genius
for
intrigue
which
rendered

he
remained

In

and

might
be
reckoned
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
that
time
more
than
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
smaller
but
still
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
On
<NUMBER>
of
those
immense
staircases
,
upon
whose
space
modern
civilization
would
build
a
whole
house
.
The
day
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
himself
the
assemblage
was
imposing
,
particularly
for
a
provincial
just
arriving
from
his
province
.
It
was
,
then
,
into
the
midst
of
this
tumult
and
disorder
that
our
young
man
advanced
with
a
beating
heat
,
ranging
his
long
rapier
up
his
<UNK>
leg
,
and
keeping
<NUMBER>
hand
on
the
edge
of
his
cap
,
with
that
half-smile
of
the
embarrassed
a
provincial
who
wishes
to
put
on
a
good
face
.
<NUMBER>
of
them
,
stationed
upon
the
top
stair
,
naked
sword
in
hand
,
prevented
,
or
at
least
endeavored
to
prevent
,
the
<NUMBER>
others
from
ascending
.
A
circle
was
formed
around
them
.
He
believed
himself
transported
into
that
famous
country
of
giants
into
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
afterward
went
and
was
so
frightened
;
and
yet
he
had
not
gained
the
goal
,
for
there
were
still
the
landing
place
and
the
antechamber
.
But
if
his
<UNK>
were
shocked
on
the
landing
,
his
respect
for
the
cardinal
was
<UNK>
in
the
antechamber
.
Nevertheless
,
when
the
name
of
the
king
was
now
and
then
uttered
<UNK>
amid
all
these
cardinal
jests
,
a
sort
of
gag
seemed
to
close
for
a
moment
on
all
these
jeering
mouths
.
We
have
no
need
,
therefore
,
to
say
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
dared
not
join
in
the
conversation
,
only
he
looked
with
all
his
eyes
and
listened
with
all
his
ears
,
stretching
his
<NUMBER>
senses
so
as
to
lose
nothing
;
and
despite
his
confidence
on
the
paternal
<UNK>
,
he
felt
himself
carried
by
his
tastes
and
led
by
his
instincts
to
praise
rather
than
to
blame
the
unheard-of
things
which
were
taking
place
.
The
center
of
the
most
animated
group
was
a
Musketeer
of
great
height
and
haughty
countenance
,
dressed
in
a
costume
so
peculiar
as
to
attract
general
attention
.
It
was
for
this
reason
,
as
he
said
to
those
around
him
,
that
he
had
put
on
his
cloak
;
and
while
he
spoke
with
a
lofty
air
and
twisted
his
mustache
disdainfully
,
all
admired
his
embroidered
baldric
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
more
than
anyone
.
It
is
a
folly
,
I
admit
,
but
still
it
is
the
fashion
.
It
was
given
to
you
by
that
veiled
lady
I
met
you
with
the
other
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
near
the
gate
<PROPER_NOUN>
Honor
.
''
The
wonder
was
increased
,
though
the
doubt
continued
to
exist
.
He
was
a
stout
man
,
of
about
<NUMBER>
-
or
<UNK>
,
with
an
open
,
ingenuous
countenance
,
a
black
,
mild
eye
,
and
cheeks
rosy
and
downy
as
an
autumn
peach
.
This
<UNK>
appeared
to
dispel
all
doubts
with
regard
to
the
baldric
.
``
And
what
does
he
say
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
is
the

''
``

``

``

In

I

I

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
at
the
moment
in
rather
ill-humor
,
nevertheless
he
saluted
the
young
man
politely
,
who
bowed
to
the
very
ground
;
and
he
smiled
on
receiving
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
response
,
the
Bearnese
accent
of
which
recalled
to
him
at
the

time
his
youth

his

-
a
double
remembrance
which
makes
a

smile
at
all
ages
;
but
stepping
toward
the
antechamber
and
making
a

D'Artagnan
with
his

,
as

ran
through

immediately
quitted
the

advanced
toward

closed

in

with

asked

<PROPER_NOUN>

At

the

became
an

;
nothing
was
to

A
burst
of
satisfaction
hailed
the

carried
away
by

At

not

crowded

behind

the

closed

At

smiling

this
smile
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
judged
that
he
had
not
to
deal
with
a
fool

changing
the

came
straight
to
the
point

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

fixing
upon

a

He
could
not
refrain
from
a
smile
of
visible
satisfaction
;

this

soon
disappeared
,

returning
to
the
adventure
of

was
moderately
reassured

by
the
aspect

full

astute

affected
humility

proved

``

the

turning
the

He
began
to
reflect
upon

they
were
numerous

inauspicious

Sure
of
being
killed

it

be
understood

with

saw

passed

<PROPER_NOUN>
invited
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
follow

although
ignorant

he
accepted

not

his

lost

as
it
would
have
been
impossible

D'Artagnan
turned
round
as

fixed

So
the

crossed
close

and
as
D'Artagnan
stood
firm

seized

<PROPER_NOUN>

the

back

<UNK>

this

<UNK>
was
at

Make
it

I
listen

But
has
the
wounded
man
retained
his
senses

''
``
Well
,
monsieur

let
us
go
to
him

Both
descended
to
the
chamber
in
which
the
wounded
man
lay
.
That
happened
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
foreseen
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
entertained
good
company
,
wholly
<UNK>
,
though
.
The
king
had
not
yet
returned
from
hunting
.
His
eyes
therefore
were
fixed
in
a
sort
of
agony
upon
the
door
through
which
the
king
must
enter
.
This
disposition
,
visible
as
it
was
in
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
did
not
prevent
the
courtiers
from
ranging
themselves
along
his
pathway
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
the
eyes
of
the
king
fell
upon
him
,
he
sustained
the
look
with
so
much
firmness
that
it
was
the
king
who
dropped
his
eyes
;
after
which
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
grumbling
,
entered
his
apartment
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
the
king
's
cabinet
boldly
,
and
found
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
a
very
ill
humor
,
seated
on
an
armchair
,
beating
his
boot
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
.
This
was
,
in
fact
,
the
worst
complaint
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
would
sometimes
take
<NUMBER>
of
his
courtiers
to
a
window
and
say
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

let
us
weary
ourselves
together

``
A

indeed

I
shall

give
up

up

The
misfortune
is
great

I
think
you
have

After

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

feigning
the
most

But
yet

continued
the

``
undoubtedly
my

quietly

``
No

the

entered
in

I
sometimes

Speak

However
ill
the
king
might
sleep
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
slept
still
worse
.
If
the
king
was
still
irritated

they

depart
without
being
seen
;
if
the
king
consented
to
see

they

The
duke
came
straight
up
to
him
,
and
said
:

If

added
the

,
taking
a
handful
of
gold
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
putting
it
into
the
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
put
his
<NUMBER>
pistoles
into
his
pocket
without
any

on

thanking
his

greatly
.
``
Oh

''
Ah
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
The
king
waved
his
hand
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
left
him
and
rejoined
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
whom
he
found
sharing
the
<NUMBER>
pistoles
with
D'Artagnan
.
The
repast
was
carried
into
effect
that
very
day
,
and
the
lackey
waited
at
table
.
He
felt
a
slight
disappointment
,
however
,
when
he
saw
that
this
place
was
already
taken
by
a
<UNK>
named
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
signified
to
him
that
the
state
of
his
household
,
though
great
,
would
not
support
<NUMBER>
servants
,
and
that
he
must
enter
into
the
service
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
slept
in
the
antechamber
upon
a
coverlet
taken
from
the
bed
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
that
time
made
<UNK>
to
do
without

During
the
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
that
he
had
lived
in
the
strictest
intimacy
with
his
companions
,
Porthos
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
could
remember
having
often
seen
him
smile
,
but
had
never
heard
him
laugh
.
He
never
spoke
of
women
.
He
never
spoke
to
him
,
except
under
the
most
extraordinary
occasions
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
we
have
seen
,
had
a
character
exactly
opposite
to
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
had
not
so
noble
an
air
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
commencement
of
their
intimacy
often
rendered
him
unjust
toward
that
gentleman
,
whom
he
endeavored
to
<UNK>
by
his
splendid
dress
.
Let
us
pass
,
then
,
from
the
valet
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
valet
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
had
doublets
cut
out
of
his
old
clothes
and
<UNK>
cloaks
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
thanks
to
a
very
intelligent
tailor
,
who
made
his
clothes
look
as
good
as
new
by
turning
them
,
and
whose
wife
was
suspected
of
wishing
to
make
<PROPER_NOUN>
descend
from
his
aristocratic
habits
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
very
good
figure
when
attending
on
his
master
.
For
the
rest
,
he
was
dumb
,
blind
,
and
deaf
,
and
of
<UNK>
fidelity
.
Some
fragments
of
past
splendor
appeared
here
and
there
upon
the
walls
of
this
modest
lodging
;
a
sword
,
for
example
,
richly
<UNK>
,
which
belonged
by
its
make
to
the
times
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
I
,
the
hilt
of
which
alone
,
encrusted
with
precious
stones
,
might
be
worth
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
pistoles
,
and
which
,
nevertheless
,
in
his
moments
of
greatest
distress
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
never
pledged
or
offered
for
sale
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
saying
anything
,
emptied
his
pockets
,
got
together
all
his
jewels
,
purses
,
<UNK>
,
and
gold
chains
,
and
offered
them
all
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
as
to
the
sword
,
he
said
it
was
sealed
to
its
place
and
should
never
quit
it
until
its
master
should
himself
quit
his
lodgings
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
lived
in
an
apartment
,
large
in
size
and
of
very
sumptuous
appearance
,
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

With
regard
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
we
know
how
he
was
lodged
,
and
we
have
already
made
acquaintance
with
his
lackey

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
met
with
great
crosses
in
love
,
and
that
a
frightful
treachery
had
forever
poisoned
the
life
of
this
gallant
man
.
<UNK>
and
indiscreet
,
it
was
as
easy
to
see
through
him
as
through
a
crystal
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
This
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
angry
,
but
assumed
the
most
modest
air
and
replied
in
a
friendly
tone
,
``
My
dear
friend
,
do
not
forget
that
I
wish
to
belong
to
the

and
that
I
avoid
all
mundane
opportunities

``
But
what
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
I
had
,
at
the
moment
of
being
ordained

a
little
difficulty
with

But
that
would
not
interest
you

and
I
am
taking
up
your

''
So
you
see
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
if
you
are
not
in
a

I
am
very
much
in
a

In
the
meanwhile
,
he
looked
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
an

<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
as
an

something

valet

supported
his
good
fortune
nobly
.
``
This
is
all
very
easy
for
you
to
say

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
for
you

consequently
never
exchange
ill
words

D'Artagnan
did
reflect
,
and
resolved
to
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
provisionally
;
which
he
did
with
the
<UNK>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
carried
into
everything
.
This
manner
of
acting
roused
much
respect
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
policy
among
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
They
rose
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
winter
,
about
<NUMBER>
in
summer
,
and
went
to
take
the
<UNK>
and
see
how
things
went
on
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
appreciated
him
at

first
glance
and
who
bore
him
a
real
affection
,
never
ceased
recommending
him
to
the
king
.
<NUMBER>
fine
morning
the
king
commanded
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
admit
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
a
cadet
in
his
company
of
Guards
.
Then
it
became
the
turn
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
mount
guard
with
D'Artagnan
when
he
was
on
duty
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
succeeded
him
;
and
thanks
to
<NUMBER>
of
those
<UNK>
to
which
he
was
accustomed
,
he
was
able
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
all
for
a
fortnight
.
Unfortunately
he
was
in
a
bad
vein
;
he
lost
all
,
together
with
<NUMBER>
pistoles
for
which
he
had
given
his
word
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
<NUMBER>
occasions

contrived
in
the
same
manner
that
his
friends
should
partake
of
them
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
<NUMBER>
of
them
.
D'Artagnan
thus
felt
himself
humiliated
in
having
only
procured
<NUMBER>
meal
and
a
half
for
his
companions
-
as
the
breakfast
at

could

in
return
for
the

which
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
procured
him

The

that
astonished
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
that

never

No

it

just
struck

by

<PROPER_NOUN>
owned
nothing

The
mercer
had
said
that
he
was
rich
;
the
young

might
easily
guess
that
with
so
weak
a
man
as
<PROPER_NOUN>

;
and
interest
was
almost
foreign
to
this
commencement
of

,
which
had
been
the
consequence
of
it
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
the
reader
,
from
whom
we
have
not
concealed
the
state
of
his
fortune
,
very
well
knows
-
D'Artagnan
was
not
a
millionaire
;
he
hoped
to
become
<NUMBER>
someday
,
but
the
time
which
in
his
own
mind
he
fixed
upon
for
this
happy
change
was
still
far
distant
.
The
pretty
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
just
the
woman
to
walk
with
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
in
the
fair
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
company
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
often
remarked
this
.
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
pushed
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
,
denying
him
aloud
although
he
had
promised
in
a
whisper
to
save
him
.
<UNK>
D'Artagnan
forgets
his
host
,
or
appears
to
forget
him
,
under
the
pretense
of
not
knowing
where
he
has
been
carried
,
we
will
not
forget
him
,
and
we
know
where
he
is
.
Now
,
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
at
home
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
to
his
abode
,
he
had
doubtless
hastened
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
finding
nobody
there
but
his
other
<NUMBER>
companions
perhaps
,
they
would
not
be
able
to
conceive
what
all
this
meant
.
First
love
is
accompanied
by
such
excessive
joy
that
unless
the
joy
be
allowed
to
overflow
,
it
will
stifle
you
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
passing
along
a
lane
on
the
spot
where
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
now
situated
,
breathing
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
which
were
borne
upon
the

from
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

and
which
arose
from
the
gardens
refreshed
by
the
dews
of

and
the

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
passed
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
already
perceived
the
door
of
his
friend
's
house
,
shaded
by
a
mass
of
sycamores
and
clematis
which
formed
a
vast
arch
opposite
the
front
of
it
,
when
he
perceived
something
like
a
shadow
issuing
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Shall
I
go
and
offer
her
my
services
?
''
But
a
woman
who
<UNK>
in
the
streets
at
this
hour
only
<UNK>
out
to
meet
her
lover
.
There
were
but
<NUMBER>
hotels
in
this
part
of
the
street
;
and
only
<NUMBER>
windows
looking
toward
the
road
,
<NUMBER>
of

was
in
a
pavilion
parallel
to
that
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
occupied
,
the

belonging
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
.
Ah
,
my
dear
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
this
time
I
shall
find
you
out
.
''
Nevertheless
,
whether
the
cough
had
been
answered
by
a
similar
signal
which
had
fixed
the
<UNK>
of
the
nocturnal
<UNK>
,
or
whether
without
this
aid
she
saw
that
she
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
her
journey
,
she
resolutely
drew
near
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
shutter
,
and
tapped
,
at
<NUMBER>
equal
intervals
,
with
her
bent
finger
.
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
Very
pretty
!
''
He
was
right
;
at
the
end
of
some
seconds
<NUMBER>
sharp
taps
were
heard
inside
.
Besides
,
the
eyes
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
have
,
as
it
is
asserted
,
like
those
of
cats
,
the
faculty
of
seeing
in
the
dark
.
``
What
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
that
handkerchief
signify
?
''
Upon
gaining
this
advantage
D'Artagnan
was
near
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
;
it
was
not
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
was
conversing
with
the
nocturnal
visitor
,
it
was
a
woman
!
At
length
the
shutter
closed
.
This
must
be
,
then
,
an
affair
of
importance
;
and
what
is
the
most
important
affair
to
a
woman
of
<NUMBER>
!
There
was
a
very
simple
means
of
<UNK>
himself
whither
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
going
;
that
was
to
follow
her
.
It
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
overtake
a

embarrassed
with
her
cloak
.
These

were
nothing

may
be
made

<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
she

she
reopened

uttered

asked
the

with

resumed
its

By

She
seemed

however

by

to
recognize
a

,
and
approaching
that
door
,
``

<NUMBER>
personage
concerned

we
have
appeared

take

very
little
notice

introduced

he
became

on
the
part

who
had
brought
him

the
object

the

<NUMBER>
guards
attended
the

who
made
him
traverse
a

and
enter
a
corridor
in
which
were
<NUMBER>
sentinels
,
opened
a
door
and
pushed
him
<UNK>
into
a
low
room
,
where
the
only
furniture
was
a
table
,
a
chair
,
and
a
commissary

This
commissary
was
a

of

<UNK>
mien
,
with
a
pointed
nose
,
with
yellow
and
salient
cheek

,
with
eyes
small
but
keen
and
penetrating
,
and
an
expression
of
countenance
resembling
at
once
the
<UNK>
and
the
fox
.
The
commissary
then
,
instead
of
continuing
to
interrogate
him
,
made
him
a
long
speech
upon
the
danger
there
is
for
an
obscure
citizen
to
meddle

At
bottom
the
character

was

from

away

while

wrote

in

dispatched
it
by

He
believed

silently
,
while

<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
lamentations
enough
to
break
the
heart
of

tiger

These
steps
drew
near
to
his
dungeon
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
guards
appeared
.
Where
,
my

?
''
``
Ah
,
my

my

''
They
made
him
enter
this
carriage
,
the
officer
placed
himself
by
his
side
,
the
door
was
locked
,
and
they
were
left
in
a
rolling
prison
.
He
thought
the
carriage
was
about
to
stop
there
.
But
when
he
saw
the
carriage
take
the
way
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
he
perceived
the
pointed
roof
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
carriage
passed
under
the
arcade
,
he
believed
it
was
over
with
him
.
Indeed
,
the
carriage
crossed
the
fatal
spot
without
stopping
.
He
could
not
yet
see
that
dreadful
cross
,
but
he
felt
somehow
as
if
it
were
coming
to
meet
him
.
The
carriage
,
which
had
been
stopped
for
a
minute
,
resumed
its
way
,
passed
through
the
crowd
,
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

turned
into
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
stopped
before
a
low
door
.
He
had
walked
as
<NUMBER>
walks
in
a
dream
;
he
had
a
glimpse
of
objects
as
through
a
fog
.
At
this
movement
,
which
nobody
opposed
,
he
resumed
a
little
courage
,
and
ventured
to
draw
up
<NUMBER>
leg
and
then
the
other
.
said
he
.
The
latter
obeyed
without
reply
,
and
entered
the
chamber
,
where
he
appeared
to
be
expected
.
Although
this
man
was
scarcely
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
of
age
,
hair
,
mustaches
,
and
royal
,
all
began
to
be
gray
.
The
poor
mercer
remained
standing
at
the
door
,
while
the
eyes
of
the
personage
we
have
just
described
were
fixed
upon
him
,
and
appeared
to
wish
to
penetrate
even
into
the
depths
of
the
past
.
``
That
's
well

From
time
to
time
the

by
the
chimney
raised
his
eyes
from
the
<UNK>

and
plunged
them
like
poniards
into
the
heart
of
the

mercer
.
``

the

The

reappeared
.
This
is
quite
another

does
not
resemble

The

took
Bonacieux
by

led
him
into

where
he
found

The

entered

The

without

bowed

took

entered

The

prepared
their
beds
and
barricaded
their

within

when
someone
knocked
at
the

shutter
;
they
demanded
who
was
there
,
and
recognizing
the
voices
of
their
lackeys
,
opened
the
shutter
.
``
And
on
what
will
you
sleep
?

<PROPER_NOUN>
host

face
does
not

me
at

it

''
Toward
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
somebody
endeavored
to
open
the
door
;
but
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
awoke
in
an
instant
and
cried
,
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
When
they
opened
the
window
,
they
saw
the
poor
lad
lying
senseless
,
with
his
head
split
by
a
blow
with
a
<UNK>
.
All
these
successive
accidents
were
perhaps
the
result
of
chance
;
but
they
might
be
the
fruits
of
a
plot
.
He
asked
where
their
masters
were
,
and
was
informed
that
they
had
passed
the
night
in
the
inn
,
and
were
then
settling
their
bill
with
the

.
The

was
alone
,
seated
before
his

,
<NUMBER>
of

which
was
partly
open

At

instant
,
<NUMBER>
men
,
armed

teeth
,
entered
by

,
and
rushed
upon

.
<UNK>
,
spur

''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
they
galloped
on
.
Forward
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
forward
!
And
both
,
with
free
use
of
the
spur
,
arrived
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
drawing
bit
.
Fortunately
,
as
we
have
said
,
they
were
within
a
<NUMBER>
paces
of
the
city
;
they
left
their
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
upon
the
high
road
,
and
ran
toward
the
quay
.
``
Nothing
would
be
more
easy

said
the
captain
of
a

ready
to
set

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
believed
him
to
be
dead
,
or
at

insensible

and
went
toward
him
for
the
purpose
of
taking
the
order

but
the
moment
he
extended
his
hand
to
search
for
it
,
the
wounded
man
,
who
had
not
dropped
his
sword
,
plunged
the
point
into
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
breast
,
crying
,
``

''
D'Artagnan
searched
his
pockets
,
and
took
from
<NUMBER>
of

the
order
for
the
passage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
grasped
him
by

and
pressed
as

could
.
``

!
''
``
And
now

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
to

And
they
both
set
forward
as
fast
as
they
could
toward
the
country
house
of
the
worthy
<UNK>
.
``
Yes

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
here
it

``
It

``

``

He
thanked
the

bowed

and
departed

said
he
,
on
perceiving
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
In
that

''
said
the
<UNK>
.
It
was
the
cannon
which
announced
the
closing
of
the
port
.
Still
further
,
his
shirt
had
stuck
to
the
wound
,
and
he
had
lost
only
a
few
drops
of
blood
.
On
the
morrow
,
at
break
of
day
,
they
were
still
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
leagues
from
the
coast
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
post
was
well
served
.
The
duke
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
hunting
with
the
king
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
been
lifted
from
his
horse
as
stiff
as
a
rush
;
the
poor
lad
's
strength
was
almost
exhausted
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
soon
caught
the
sound
of
his
master
's
voice
calling
his
<UNK>
.
``
A
singular
introduction
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
discreetly
kept
in
the
background
.
``
I
!
''
Speak

speak

''
``
From
her
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
I

said
he
,
showing
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
place
where
it
had
been
pierced
through
.
``
Oh
,
nothing
but
a
scratch
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Come
,
monsieur
,
come
!
''
But
that
which
astonished
him
most
was
that
the
cardinal
,
so
deeply
interested
in
preventing
this
young
man
from
setting
his
foot
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
not
succeeded
in
arresting
him
on
the
road
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
imagined
that
on
arriving
in
town
the
duke
would
<UNK>
his
pace
,
but
it
was
not
so
.
On
entering
the
court
of
his
hotel
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
from
his
horse
,
and
without
thinking
what
became
of
the
animal
,
threw
the
bridle
on
his
neck
,
and
sprang
toward
the
vestibule
.
In
the
alcove
of
this
chamber
was
a
door
concealed
in
the
tapestry
which
the
duke
opened
with
a
little
gold
key
which
he
wore
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
.
The
<NUMBER>
found
themselves
in
a
small
chapel
covered
with
a
tapestry
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
silk
worked
with
gold
,
and
brilliantly
lighted
with
a
vast
number
of
candles
.
The
duke
approached
the
altar
,
knelt
as
a
priest
might
have
done
before
a
crucifix
,
and
opened
the
casket
.
Then
,
he
began
to
kiss
,
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
,
those
dear
studs
with
which
he
was
about
to
part
.
``
All
is
lost
!
''
Hold
;
see
!
said
the
duke
.
I
have
never
seen
her
from
that
day
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
grating
his
teeth
with
rage
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
next
!
cried
the
duke
,
opening
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
But
although
the
jeweler
had
been
mentioned
first
,
it
was
the
secretary
who
first
made
his
appearance
.
I
wish
them
to
be
<UNK>
immediately
.
''
``
You
are
right
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
If
the

are
not
yet
gone
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
will
not
arrive
till
after
you

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
by
the
expression
of
the
young
man
's
face
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
,
and
he
smiled
.
I
broke
my
word
,
it
is
true
;
but
what
signifies
that
?
He
was
lost
in
these
reflections
when
the
goldsmith
entered
.
``
How
many
days
would
it
require
to
make
<NUMBER>
studs
exactly
like
them
?
``
My
Lord
,
they
shall
be
yours
.
''
There
is
no
one
but
myself
can
so
execute
them
that
one
can
not
tell
the
new
from
the
old
.
''
The
goldsmith
knew
the
duke
.
``
Oh
,
you
may
even
see
her
if
you
like
,
my
dear
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
conducted
the
goldsmith
to
the
chamber
destined
for
him
,
and
which
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
was
transformed
into
a
<UNK>
.
``
Now
,
my
young
friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
all
our
own
.
``
At
present
,
I
confess
,
that
is
the
thing
I
stand
most
in
need
of

''
In
the
eyes
of
everybody
this
was
a
declaration
of
war
between
the

``
Be
satisfied

will
tell
all

keep
it

''
He
saw
that
the
duke
was
searching
for
a
means
of
making
him
accept
something
and
the
idea
that
the
blood
of
his
friends
and
himself
was
about
to
be
paid
for
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
gold
was
strangely
repugnant
to
him

And
still
further

it
is
very
probable
I
should
not
have
done
anything
of
this
,
if
it
had
not
been
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
someone
who

``
You

confess
to
you
that
I
see
nothing

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
to
the

was
retiring

<NUMBER>
vessels
were
waiting
to
set
out

<UNK>
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
talked
of
as
near
and
certain
,
and
the
jolly
sailors
were
having
a

``

demanded
<PROPER_NOUN>

Do

He
left
his
address
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
set
off
again
at
the
same
pace
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
On
the
morrow
,
nothing
was
talked
of
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
but
the
ball
which
the
aldermen
of
the
city
were
to
give
to
the
king
and
queen
,
and
in
which
their
<UNK>
were
to
dance
the
famous
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
the
favorite
ballet
of
the
king
.
These
keys
were
given
up
to
him
instantly
.
The
company
of
French
guards
was
composed
of
half
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
men
and
half
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

men
.
As
next
to
the
queen
,
she
was
the
most
considerable
personage
of
the
fete
,
she
was
received
by
the
city
<UNK>
,
and
placed
in
a
box
opposite
to
that
which
the
queen
was
to
occupy
.
Immediately
the
<UNK>
,
clothed
in
their
cloth
robes
and
preceded
by
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
each
holding
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
his
hand
,
went
to
attend
upon
the
king
,
whom
they
met
on
the
steps
,
where
the
<UNK>
of
the
merchants
made
him
the
speech
of
welcome
-
a
compliment
to
which
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
with
an
apology
for
coming
so
late
,
laying
the
blame
upon
the
cardinal
,
who
had
detained
him
till
eleven
o'clock
,
talking
of
affairs
of
state
.
In
each
of
these
closets
were
placed
masquerade
dresses
.
Half
an
hour
after
the
entrance
of
the
king
,
fresh
acclamations
were
heard
;
these
announced
the
arrival
of
the
queen
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
upon
those
of
the
queen
,
and
a
smile
of
terrible
joy
passed
over
his
lips
;
the
queen
did
not
wear
her
diamond
studs
.
The
king
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
without
a
mask
,
and
the
ribbons
of
his
doublet
scarcely
tied
.
``
And
you
were
wrong
,
madame
.
Everybody
looked
and
listened
with
astonishment
,
comprehending
nothing
of
what
passed
.
On
his
part
the
king
returned
to
his
apartment
.
The
king
came
out
first
from
his
room
.
The
cardinal
drew
near
to
the
king
,
and
placed
in
his
hand
a
small
casket
.
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
the
latter
;
``
only
,
if
the
queen
has
the
studs
,
which
I
very
much
doubt
,
count
them
,
sire
,
and
if
you
only
find
<NUMBER>
,
ask
her
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
can
have
stolen
from
her
the
<NUMBER>
studs
that
are
here
.
''
She
wore
a
beaver
had
with
blue
feathers
,
a
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
velvet
,
fastened
with
diamond
clasps
,
and
a
<UNK>
of
blue
satin
,
embroidered
with
silver
.
The
only
question
was
,
had
she
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
?
The
king
danced
facing
the
queen
,
and
every
time
he
passed
by
her
,
he
devoured
with
his
eyes
those
studs
of
which
he
could
not
ascertain
the
number
.
``
I
thank
you
,
madame
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
the
deference
you
have
shown
to
my

bring
them
back

''
In
fact
the
king
counted
them
,
and
the
<NUMBER>
studs
were
all
on
her
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
shoulder
.
``
This
means
,
sire
,

replied
the
cardinal
,
``
that
I
was
desirous
of
presenting
her
Majesty
with
these
<NUMBER>
studs

and
that
not
daring
to
offer

myself
,
I
adopted
this

of

her
to
accept
them
.
''
The
queen
had
just
regained
her
chamber
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
retire
,
when
he
felt
his
should
lightly
touched
.
The
haste
which
the
young
woman
was
in
to
convey
to
the
queen
the
excellent
news
of
the
happy
return
of
her
messenger
prevented
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
from
exchanging
more
than
a
few
words
.
There
she
made
a
fresh
sign
of
silence
,
and
opened
a
second
door
concealed
by
tapestry
.
The
queen
appeared
cheerful
and
happy
,
which
seemed
to
astonish
the
persons
who
surrounded
her
and
who
were
accustomed
to
see
her
almost
always
sad
and
full
of

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
soon
as
he
had
lost
sight
of
his

;
and
in
such
haste
was
he
to
warm
himself
that
he
went
straight
to
a
house
set
out
with
all
the
attributes
of
a
<UNK>
tavern
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
He
gained
the
place
appointed
,
and
as
no
signal
had
been
given
him
by
which
to
announce
his
presence
,
he
waited
.
But
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
all
aspects
were
clothed
happily
,
all
ideas
wore
a
smile
,
all
shades
were
<UNK>
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
little
pavilion
situated
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
,
of
which
all
the
windows
were
closed
with
shutters
,
except
<NUMBER>
on
the
first
story
.
The
belfry
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
sounded
half
past
<NUMBER>
.
He
drew
near
to
the
window
,
and
placing
himself
so
that
a
ray
of
light
should
fall
upon
the
letter
as
he
held
it
,
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
again
;
but
he
had
not
been
mistaken
,
the
appointment
was
for
<NUMBER>
o'clock
.
He
clapped
his
hands
<NUMBER>
times
-
the
ordinary
signal
of
lovers
;
but
nobody
replied
to
him
,
not
even
an
echo
.
The
tree
was
easy
to
climb
.
<NUMBER>
of
the
windows
was
broken
,
the
door
of
the
chamber
had
been
beaten
in
and
hung
,
split
in
<NUMBER>
,
on
its
hinges
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
even
fancied
he
could
recognize
amid
this
strange
disorder
,
fragments
of
garments
,
and
some
bloody
spots
<UNK>
the
cloth
and
the
curtains
.
Besides
,
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
,
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
made
a
deep
impression
in
the
soft
earth
,
which
did
not
extend
beyond
the
pavilion
,
but
turned
again
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
D'Artagnan
pursued
his
investigations
,
a
more
abundant
and
more
icy
sweat
rolled
in
large
drops
from
his
forehead
;
his
heart
was
oppressed
by
a
horrible
anguish
;
his
respiration
was
broken
and
short
.
He
ran
along
the
high
road
,
took
the
path
he
had
before
taken
,
and
reaching
the
ferry
,
interrogated
the
boatman
.
Everything
conspired
to
prove
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
his
presentiments
had
not
deceived
him
,
and
that
a
great
misfortune
had
happened
.
D'Artagnan
then
thought
of
that
cottage
,
silent
and
obscure
,
which
had
no
doubt
seen
all
,
and
could
tell
its
tale
.
It
soon
appeared
to
him
that
he
heard
a
slight
noise
within
-
a
timid
noise
which
seemed
to
tremble
lest
it
should
be
heard
.
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
!
''
Speak
!
''
The
old
man
listened
attentively
,
making
a
sign
only
that
it
was
all
so
;
and
then
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
ended
,
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
that
announced
nothing
good
.
``
Oh
!
``
In
that
case
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
,
''
continued
he
,
throwing
him
a
pistole
,
``
tell
me
what
you
have
seen
,
and
I
will
pledge
you
the
word
of
a

that
not

your
words
shall
escape
from
my
heart

''
These
horses
evidently
belonged
to
the
<NUMBER>
men
,
who
<UNK>
dressed
as
cavaliers
.
`
Yes
,
monsieur
,
the
<NUMBER>
with
which
I
gather
my
fruit
.
'
After
shutting
the
gate
behind
them
,
I
pretended
to
return
to
the
house
,
but
I
immediately
went
out
a
back
door
,
and
stealing
along
in
the
shade
of
the
hedge
,
I
gained
yonder
clump
of
elder
,
from
which
I
could
hear
and
see
everything
.
All
at
once
great
cried
resounded
in
the
pavilion
,
and
a
woman
came
to
the
window
,
and
opened
it
,
as
if
to
throw
herself
out
of
it
;
but
as
soon
as
she
perceived
the
other
<NUMBER>
men
,
she
fell
back
and
they
went
into
the
chamber
.
The
leader
closed
the
window
,
came
out
an
instant
after
by
the
door
,
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
woman
was
in
the
carriage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
entirely
overcome
by
this
terrible
story
,
remained
motionless
and
mute
,
while
all
the
demons
of
anger
and
jealousy
were
howling
in
his
heart
.
``
But
as
you
spoke
to
him
you
must
have
seen
him
.
''
``
That
's
the
man
!
''
``
Which

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
woman
,
poor
woman
,
what
have
they
done
with
you
?
''
Be
easy
,
I
am
a
gentleman
.
His
mind
was
torn
by
doubt
,
grief
,
and
despair
.
At
the
sixth
he
began
to
reflect
that
the
search
was
rather
<UNK>
.
He
was
compelled
,
them
,
after
having
swallowed
the
contents
of
his
bottle
,
to
pass
the
time
as
well
as
to
evade
suspicion
,
to
fall
into
the
<UNK>
position
in
his
corner
and
to
sleep
,
whether
well
or
ill
.
He
examined
himself
to
see
if
advantage
had
been
taken
of
his
sleep
,
and
having
found
his
diamond
ring
on
his
finger
,
his
purse
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
pistols
in
his
belt
,
he
rose
,
paid
for
his
bottle
,
and
went
out
to
try
if
he
could
have
any
better
luck
in
his
search
after
his
lackey
than
he
had
had
the
night
before
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
doubtless
give
him
good
advice
as
to
the
whole
affair
.
All
this
savors
of
his
Eminence
,
a
league
off
.
''
I
will
see
the
queen

I
will
relate
to
her
the
details

disappearance

this
poor

of
which
she
is
no

ignorant

He
bowed
to
him
,
then
,
full
of
gratitude
for
the
past
and
for
the
future
;
and
the
worthy
captain
,
who
on
his
side
felt
a
lively
interest
in
this
young
man
,
so
brave
and
so
resolute

pressed
his
hand
kindly
,
wishing
him
a
pleasant
journey

In

paleness

indicates
the

be

D'Artagnan
remarked
something
<UNK>
significant
in
the
play
of
the
wrinkled
features
of
his
countenance
.
In
consequence
of
this
feeling
of
repugnance
,
he
was
about
to
pass
without
speaking
to
him

but
,
as
he
had
done
the

accosted

While

breakfasting

with

he
held

For

he

has

There
only
his

returned

took

the

at

In

this

his

He
resolved

betrayed

could
not

At

Besides

his

then

went

his

barricaded

To
this

D'Artagnan
at

joined
an

much

selfish

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not

he
made
up
his

continued
to
walk
about

repeating

collected
a

been

never

watched

,
whom
the

could
not
induce

break
the

imposed
by

heaved
sighs
enough
to
soften
the

When

met
they
looked
<UNK>
at
<NUMBER>
another
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Have
you
found
anything

He
entered
,
after
having
twisted
his
mustache
and
elongated
his
imperial
,
which
always
announced
on
his
part
the
most
triumphant
resolutions
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
still
unperceived
,
supported
himself
against
the
other
side
.
His
hat
was
a
little
<UNK>
,
his
feather
was
a
little
faded
,
his
gold
lace
was
a

<UNK>
,
his

were
a

<UNK>
;
but
in
the
obscurity
of
the
church
these
things
were
not
seen
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
still
the
handsome
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
plain
that
this
mode
of
proceeding
piqued
the
lady
in
the
black
hood
,
for
she
bit
her
lips
till
they
bled
,
scratched
the
end
of
her
nose
,
and
could
not
sit
still
in
her

It
was
almost
imperceptible
motions
of
his

,
fingers
placed
upon
the
lips
,
little
<UNK>
smiles
,
which
really
did
assassinate
the
disdained
beauty
.
Nevertheless
,
he
understood
it
all
,
but
was
deaf
.
He
guessed
,
likewise
,
by
<UNK>
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
taking
his
revenge
for
the
defeat
of

when
the

had
proved
so
<UNK>
with
respect
to
her

<PROPER_NOUN>
went
before
her

and
instead

dipped
his

in
.
The
fair

touched
the
great
hand
of
Porthos
with
her
delicate
fingers
,
smiled
,
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
,
and
left
the
church
.
``

At

D'Artagnan
passed
in

he
cast

at

resumed
the

with
a
sigh

Less

The

uttered
a

The

shed
a

not

it

At

put

D'Artagnan
followed

The

<NUMBER>
o'clock
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
residence
.
His
only
fear
was
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
recognize
in
him
the
man
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
D'Artagnan
began
by
making
his
most
splendid
toilet
,
then
returned
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
,
and
according
to
custom
,
related
everything
to
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
the
truth
of
this
reproach
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
divine
that
,
after
all
you
have
told
me
.
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
mistrust
women
.
``
She
has
the
most
beautiful
light
hair
imaginable
!
''
I
want
to
be
enlightened
on
a
subject
;
then
,
when
I
shall
have
learned
what
I
desire
to
know
,
I
will
withdraw
.
''
He
therefore
found
D'Artagnan
alone
,
and
as
it
was
nearly
<NUMBER>
o'clock
he
took
the
young
man
with
him
.
``
You
see
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
presenting
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
his
sister
,
``
a
young
gentleman
who
has
held
my
life
in
his
hands
,
and
who
has
not
abused
his
advantage
,
although
we
have
been
twice
enemies
,
although
it
was
I
who
insulted
him
,
and
although
I
am
an
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
You
are
welcome
,
monsieur
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
voice
whose
singular
sweetness
contrasted
with
the
symptoms
of
ill-humor
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
remarked
;
``
you
have
today
acquired
eternal
rights
to
my
gratitude
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
nothing
of
this
.
He
therefore
drew
near
to
the
table
and
took
the
second
glass
.
That
pretty
little
<PROPER_NOUN>
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
already
observed
then
came
in
.
Those
lips
were
magnificent
;
they
might
be
said
to
be
of
coral
.
She
had
married
a
younger
brother
of
the
family
,
who
had
left
her
a
widow
with
<NUMBER>
child
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<UNK>
in
gallant
speeches
and
protestations
of
devotion
.
On
the
staircase
he
met
the
pretty
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
brushed
gently
against
him
as
she
passed
,
and
then
,
blushing
to
the
eyes
,
asked
his
pardon
for
having
touched
him
in
a
voice
so
sweet
that
the
pardon
was
granted
instantly
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
exceedingly
prudent
for
a
young
man
of
<NUMBER>
,
then
remembered
his
suspicions
regarding
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
twice
or
thrice
bit
her
lips
;
she
had
to
deal
with
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
played
close
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
again
on
the
morrow
and
the
day
after
that
,
and
each
day
<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
him
a
more
gracious
reception
.
On
the
morrow
he
received
the
last
touches
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
brush
for
an
hour
,
and
took
his
way
toward
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
aux
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
the
steps
of
a
man
who
was
doubly
in
favor
with
fortune
.
He
was
about
to
see
in
reality
a
certain
coffer
of
which
he
had
<NUMBER>
times
beheld
the
image
in
his
dreams
-
a
coffer
long
and
deep
,
locked
,
bolted
,
fastened
in
the
wall
;
a
coffer
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
,
and
which
the
hands
-
a
little
wrinkled
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
not
without
elegance
-
of
the
procurator
's
wife
were
about
to
open
to
his
admiring
looks
.
And
yet
,
at
the
very
door
the
Musketeer
began
to
entertain
some
doubts
.
A
shorter
clerk
came
behind
the
first
,
a
taller
clerk
behind
the
second
,
a
<UNK>
of
a
dozen
years
rising
behind
the
third
.
The
clerks
surveyed
him
with
great
curiosity
,
and
he
,
not
knowing
well
what
to
say
to
this
ascending
and
descending
scale
,
remained
<UNK>
.
The
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
produced
its
effect
upon
the
clerks
,
who
began
to
laugh
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
sharply
round
,
and
every
countenance
quickly
recovered
its
gravity
.
All
these
rooms
,
which
communicated
with
<NUMBER>
another
,
did
not
inspire
<PROPER_NOUN>
favorably
.
``
We
are
<UNK>
,
it
appears
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
Unfortunately
the
legs
began
to
refuse
their
service
to
this
bony
machine
.
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
we
are
<UNK>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
being
disconcerted
,
as
he
had
never
reckoned
upon
being
received
<UNK>
by
the
husband
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
knew
that
a
<UNK>
procurator
was
a
very
rare
variety
in
the
species
,
smiled
a
little
,
and
colored
a
great
deal
.
This
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
the
blow
right
in
his
stomach
,
and
felt
it
.
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
he
tried
to
smile
.
The
clerks
,
who
,
as
it
appeared
,
had
<UNK>
unusual
perfumes
in
the
house
,
were
of
military
punctuality
,
and
held
their
stools
in
hand
quite
ready
to
sit
down
.
``
in
my
cousin
's
place
,
I
would
not
keep
such
<UNK>
!
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
,
and
upon
a
sign
from
her
everyone
eagerly
took
his
seat
.
After
the
soup
the
maid
brought
a
boiled
fowl
-
a
piece
of
magnificence
which
caused
the
eyes
of
the
<UNK>
to
dilate
in
such
a
manner
that
they
seemed
ready
to
burst
.
The
fowl
must
have
been
sought
for
a
long
time
on
the
perch
,
to
which
it
had
retired
to
die
of
old
age
.
And
he
looked
round
to
see
if
anybody
partook
of
his
opinion
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
he
saw
nothing
but
eager
eyes
which
were
devouring
,
in
anticipation
,
that
sublime
fowl
which
was
the
object
of
his
contempt
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
distributed
this
dish
to
the
young
men
with
the
moderation
of
a
good
<UNK>
.
This
brought
them
,
by
the
end
of
the
repast
,
to
swallowing
a
drink
which
from
the
color
of
the
ruby
had
passed
to
that
of
a
pale
<UNK>
.
``
Will
you
eat
any
of
these
beans
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
There
was
silence
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
how
I
have
eaten
!
''
Upon
a
look
from
the
procurator
,
accompanied
by
a
smile
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
arose
slowly
from
the
table
,
folded
their
napkins
more
slowly
still
,
bowed
,
and
retired
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
knit
his
eyebrows
because
there
were
too
many
good
things
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
about
in
his
chair
,
``
a
real
feast
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
This
is
fine
!
''
Ah
!
The
procurator
's
wife
took
<PROPER_NOUN>
into
an
adjoining
room
,
and
they
began
to
lay
the
<UNK>
of
a
reconciliation
.
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
the
procurator
's
wife
,
groaning
,
``
that
unfortunate
outfit
!
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
procurator
's
wife
waited
tremblingly
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
it
does
not
exceed
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>

Why

that
is
a

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
that

meant

''
``
Well

then
!
``

These
<NUMBER>

livres
he
reckoned
upon
putting

into
his
pocket

resumed
the
procurator
's
wife
,
hesitatingly
;
``
but
that
is
doing
things
in
<UNK>
style
,
my
friend

But
then
you
understand

<PROPER_NOUN>

a

with

''
``
My

choose

``
Certainly
it
is
empty

''
replied
the
procurator
's
wife
,
in
real
innocence
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
in
the
dilemma
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
Musketeer
returned
home
hungry
and
in
bad
humor
.
``
Good
!
''
``
Speak
,
my
child
,
speak

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
I
listen

``

''
``
Come

<PROPER_NOUN>

Kitty
guessed
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
young
man
,
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
I
am
mad
for
her
!
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
monsieur

but
out
of
the
regard
I
have
for
you

I
have
taken
the
resolution
to
tell
you
so
.
''
``
Then
you
do
n't
believe
me
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seizing
the
letter
.
``
His

his
name

''
The
remembrance
of
the
scene
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
itself
to
the
mind
of
the
presumptuous
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
nothing

''
and
he
read
,
``
You
have
not
answered
my

note

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
voice
full
of
compassion
,
and
pressing
anew
the
young
man
's
hand
.
``
You
know
what
it
is
to
be
in

''
``
And
what
sort
of

you
take

demanded
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
How
do
you
know

Speak

I
beg

``

``
And
does

But
this

our

saw
at

all
the

to

from
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

the

``

clapping

``

quickly
when
it
is
passed
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
,
took
his
hat
,
as
if
it
had
been
his
intention
to
obey

then
,
opening
quickly
the
door
of
a
large
closet
instead
of
that
leading
to
the
staircase
,
he
buried
himself
amid
the
robes
and
dressing

of

``
Well

cried

in

springing
forward

had
the

With
a

more
heart

he
might
have
been
contented
with
this
new
conquest

but
the
principal
features
of
his

were
ambition

pride

But
what
was
<UNK>
in
all
this
was
that
the
true
hatred

the
profound
hatred

the
inveterate
hatred
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

was
increased
by
his
not

killed
her
brother-in-law

Toward

end
of
the
evening
,
however

the
beautiful

became
<UNK>

she
smilingly
listened

gave

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not

silence

she
ordered

D'Artagnan
concealed
himself
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
called

undressed

sent

and
shut

This

the

did
not

argue
with

she
gave

at

And

he

off
at

Go

Not

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
on
the

all

consideration
restrained
him
.
Upon
being
informed
that
the

wanted

came
from

we
have
seen
with
what

the

followed
,

rather
went
before

;
he
ran
without

In

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
curious
to
know
what
the
mendicant
could
want
with

,
kept
pace
with
him
as
well
as
he
could

and
arrived
almost
at

he
did
;
but
his

was
not

<UNK>
your

<PROPER_NOUN>
then
<UNK>
the

,
and
perceived
a
postscript
:
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Oh

beautiful

And
he
kissed
the

with
passion

without

a

sparkled
on

``

And
having

he

heard

on

But
do

In

the

who
had
not
eaten

since
the

made
such
a
noise

raising

that
the

ordered

inquire

<PROPER_NOUN>

without

retreated
a

Stop

The

hung
upon

and
in
the
violence

she
cried

This

going

In

He
found
her
in
a
charming
humor
.
Her

put
on
a
charming
face
,
and
smiled
on
her
graciously
;
but
alas
!
At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
Milady
began
to
appear
restless
.
The
young
man
felt
her
press
his
hand
,
and
comprehended
that
this
was
a
sentiment
,
not
of
coquetry
,
but
of
gratitude
because
of
his
departure
.
It
was
necessary
that
D'Artagnan
should
find
alone
the
staircase
and
the
little
chamber
.
<UNK>
to
her
own
room
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
thrown
the
purse
into
a
corner
,
where
it
lay
open
,
<UNK>
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
gold
pieces
on
the
carpet
.
As
little
sensitive
as
was
the
heart
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
was
touched
by
this
mute
sorrow
;
but
he
held
too
<UNK>
to
his
projects
,
above
all
to
this
<NUMBER>

to
change
the
<UNK>
which
he
had
laid
out
in
advance
.
Presently
they
heard
<PROPER_NOUN>
retire
to
her
room
.
Milady
seemed
overcome
with
joy
,
and
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
repeat
the
smallest
details
of
the
pretended
interview
of
the
<UNK>
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
he
received
the
letter
;
how
he
had
responded
;
what
was
the
expression
of
his
face
;
if
he
seemed
very
amorous
.
Hardly
had
<PROPER_NOUN>
seen
,
through
a
<UNK>
in
his
closet
,
that
the
whole
apartment
was
in
obscurity
,
than
he
slipped
out
of
his
concealment
,
at
the
very
moment
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
the
door
of
communication
.
``
Oh
,
my
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
my

''
At
this
appeal
<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
<PROPER_NOUN>
quietly
away
,
and
slipped
into
the
chamber
.
``
Yes
,
Count
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
her
softest
voice
,
and
pressing
his
hand
in
her
own
,
``
I
am
happy

the
love
which
your

<PROPER_NOUN>
remembered
having
seen
this
ring
on
the
finger
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
it
was
a
magnificent
sapphire
,
encircled
with
<UNK>
.
``
This

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself

``
Oh

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
to

Presently
it
sounded
<NUMBER>
o'clock

The
next
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
to
find
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
<NUMBER>
fashion

have
a

''
``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
it
reminds

I
did

``
That

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
examined
it
and
became
very
pale
.
``
How

this
ring
come
into
the
hands
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
?
``
I
thought

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
no

I
was
mistaken

''
But
stop
!
``
Look

''
said
he
,
``
is
it
not
strange

''
As
I
told
you
,
it
is
an
old
family
jewel

``
I
gave
it
away
in
a

Take
my
advice

renounce
this

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
you
have
the
courage

''
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
like
a
man
who
wishes
it
understood
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
be
left
alone
with
his
thoughts
.
Her
mistress
was
mad
with
love
,
intoxicated
with
joy
.
Since
my
<UNK>
I
have
so
many
affairs
of
this
kind
on
my
hands
that
I
am
forced
to
regulate
them
a

Was
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
determined
to
keep
it
as
a
weapon
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
or
else
,
let
us
be
frank
,
did
he
not
reserve
the
sapphire
as
a
last
resource
for
his
outfit
?
She
could
scarcely
believe
in
her
happiness
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
forced
to
renew
with
the
living
voice
the
assurances
which
he
had
written
.
She
crushed
the
paper
in
her
band
,
and
turning
with
flashing
eyes
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
cried
,
``
What
is
this
letter
?
''
``
It
is
impossible
a
gentleman
could
have
written
such
a
letter
to

.
''
She
tried
to
go
toward
the
window
for
air
,
but
she
could
only
stretch
forth
her
arms
;
her
legs
failed
her
,
and
she
sank
into
an
armchair
.
``
I
thought
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
ill
,
and
I
wished
to
bring
her
help

''
responded
the
maid
,
frightened
at
the
terrible
expression
which
had
come
over
her
mistress
's
face
.
Do
you
take
me
for
half
a
woman
?
The
next
day
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
to
see
the
young
man
again
,
and
related
to
him
all
that
had
passed
on
the
preceding
evening
.
The
next
morning
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
herself
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
she
was
no
longer
joyous
and
alert
as
on
the
<NUMBER>
preceding
days
;
but
on
the
contrary
sad
as
death
.
My
brother-in-law
and
myself
expected
you
yesterday
and
the
day
before
,
but
in
vain
.
``
And
will
you
go
?
''
``
Oh
,
my
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
D'Artagnan
reassured
her
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
promised
to
remain
insensible
to
the
seductions
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
evident
that
the
servants
who
waited
in
the
antechamber
were
warned
,
for
as
soon
as
D'Artagnan
appeared
,
before
even
he
had
asked
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
visible
,
<NUMBER>
of
them
ran
to
announce
him
.
The
servant
went
out
.
D'Artagnan
approached
her
with
his
usual
gallantry
.
``
No
.
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
assumed
the
most
agreeable
air
possible
,
and
conversed
with
more
than
her
usual
brilliancy
.
Milady
smiled
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
that
he
could
<UNK>
himself
for
that
smile
.
``
Alas
!
''
said
she
.
``
Oh

difficulties
do
not
<UNK>
me

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
Nothing

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

Is
she
going
to
fall
in
love
with
me
,
by
chance

this
fair
inconstant
;
and
will
she
be
disposed
to
give
me
myself
another
sapphire
like
that
which
she
gave
me
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
Order
;
I
am
ready

``
I
am
all
attention

said
he
.
-

and
beautiful
as

are

<PROPER_NOUN>
I
reckon
on
you
as
an
auxiliary
?
''
``
Then
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
since
you
are
as
generous
as

are
loving

''
She
stopped
.
``
Do
not
overwhelm
me
with
happiness
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
covering
with
kisses
the
hands
abandoned
to
him
.
``
I
am
ready
,
''
said
he
.
``
Instantly
!
''
``
You
know
the
only
reply
that
I
desire
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
the
only
<NUMBER>
worthy
of
you
and
of
me
!
''
cried
she
,
smiling
.
``
Quite
certain
?
''
said
she
.
``
Remember
that
his
name
is
all
my
secret

''
What
is
his
name
?
''
``
It
is
surely
not
<NUMBER>

my
friends

''
``
Not
if
it
were
my
own
brother
!
''
``
Alas
,
do
you
love
nothing
else
in
me
?
''
The
warm
pressure
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
tremble
,
as
if
by
the
touch
that
fever
which
consumed
<PROPER_NOUN>
attacked
himself
.
And
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
,
She
made
no
effort
to
remove
her
lips
from
his
kisses
;
only
she
did
not
respond
to
them
.
If
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
at
that
moment
been
under
his
hand
,
he
would
have
killed
him
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seizing
both
his
hands
,
and
endeavoring
to
read
with
her
eyes
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Well
,
I
will
avenge
you
of
this
wretch
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
giving
himself
the
airs
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
cry
out
,
``
Immediately
,
''
but
she
reflected
that
such
precipitation
would
not
be
very
gracious
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
No
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
will
avenge
me
;
but
you
will
not
be
dead
.
``
But
it
seems
you
had
not
much
reason
to
complain
of

fortune
in
your
contest
with

.
''
But
would
it
be
just
to
allow
me
to
go
to
a
possible
death
without
having
given
me
at
least
something
more
than
hope
?
''
``
Oh
,
you
are
an
angel
!
''
``
Except
that
which
I
ask

you

I
hear

<PROPER_NOUN>
will
conduct
you
to
my
chamber
.
''
``
It
appears
that
these
appointments
are
all
made
for
eleven
o'clock

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
that
's
a
settled
custom
.
''
I
must
take
care
.
''
But
be
also
was
spurred
on
by
a
ferocious
desire
of
vengeance
.
At
length
the
light
disappeared
.
All
this
was
of
such
incredible
<UNK>
,
of
such
monstrous
effrontery
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
scarcely
believe
what
he
saw
or
what
he
heard
.
<UNK>
,
fury
,
offended
pride
,
all
the
passions
in
short
that
dispute
the
heart
of
an
outraged
woman
in
love
,
urged
her
to
make
a
revelation
;
but
she
reflected
that
she
would
be
totally
lost
if
she
confessed
having
assisted
in
such
a
<UNK>
,
and
above
all
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
also
be
lost
to
her
forever
.
A
secret
voice
whispered
to
him
,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
that
he
was
but
an
instrument
of
vengeance
,
that
he
was
only
caressed
till
he
had
given
death
;
but
pride
,
but
self-love
,
but
madness
silenced
this
voice
and
stifled
its
murmurs
.
<NUMBER>
hours
thus
glided
away
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
never
seriously
thought
of
this
impossible
duel
,
endeavored
to
turn
the

made
his

upon

appeared

struck

told

that
this

had
appointed

the

was

astonished

find

beat
so
violently

D'Artagnan
then
remembered
the
injunction
:
``
If

If

why
this

The
opinion

was
that

less

inside

You

something

in

Although

supported

the

was
not

a

uneasiness
as
he
ascended

knowing

believed

The

leaned

on

his

looked
intently
at

Everything

We

let

give

take
care

see

after

campaign

The
cardinal
,
then
,
was
seeking
to
preserve
him
from
some
misfortune
which
threatened
him
.
It
was
this
fear
that
restrained
him
,
so
powerful
is
the
influence
of
a
truly
great
character
on
all
that
surrounds
it
.
``
And
you
were
right
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
<NUMBER>
voice
.
The
whole
of
the
next
day
was
spent
in
preparations
for
departure
.
That
night
brought
together
all
those
comrades
of
the
Guards
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
company
of
Musketeers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
had
been
accustomed
to
associate
together
.
At
the
first
sound
of
the
morning
trumpet
the
friends
separated
;
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
hastening
to
the
hotel
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
Guards
to
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
review
over
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
set
forward
alone
on
their
march
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
waiting
for
the
king
,
which
allowed
<PROPER_NOUN>
time
to
go
and
take
a
turn
in
his
superb
equipment
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
aux
<PROPER_NOUN>

This
time
the
clerks
evinced
no
inclination
to
laugh
,
such
a
real
ear
<UNK>
did
<PROPER_NOUN>
appear
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
his
compliments
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
bade
him
farewell
.
As
long
as
the
procurator
's
wife
could
follow
him
with
her
eyes
,
she
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him
,
leaning
so
far
out
of
the
window
as
to
lead
people
to
believe
she
wished
to
precipitate
herself
.
Nobody
knew
.
Arriving
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
turned
round
to
look
gaily
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
as
it
was
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
he
looked
at
,
he
did
not
observe
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
mounted
upon
a
light
chestnut
horse
,
designated
him
with
her
finger
to
<NUMBER>
ill-looking
men
who
came
close
up
to
the
ranks
to
take
notice
of
him
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
great
political
events
of
the
reign
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<NUMBER>
of
the
great
military
enterprises
of
the
cardinal
.
Of
the
important
cities
given
up
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
as
places
of
safety
,
there
only
remained
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

Moreover
,
its
port
was
the
last
in
the
kingdom
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
open
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
by
closing
it
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
our
eternal
enemy
,
the
cardinal
completed
the
work
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
We
have
hinted
that
by
the
side
of
these
views
of
the
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
minister
,
which
belong
to
history
,
the
<UNK>
is
forced
to
recognize
the
<UNK>
motives
of
the
amorous
man
and
jealous
rival
.
It
was
,
then
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
object
,
not
only
to
get
rid
of
an
enemy
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
to
avenge
himself
on
a
rival
;
but
this
vengeance
must
be
grand
and
striking
and
worthy
in
every
way
of
a
man
who
held
in
his
hand
,
as
his
weapon
for
combat
,
the
forces
of
a
kingdom
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
under
any
pretense
be
admitted
into
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
an
ambassador
;
he
wished
to
enter
it
as
a
conqueror
.
Allow
us
to
observe
in
passing
that
in
this
fight
perished
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
a
little
orphan
girl
<NUMBER>
months
old
,
and
that
this
little

was
afterward

de

The
king
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
to
follow
as
soon
as
his
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
held
;
but
on
rising
from
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
twenty-eighth
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
felt
himself
attacked
by
fever
.
This
separation
,
which
was
no
more
than
an
unpleasant
circumstance
,
would
have
certainly
become
a
cause
of
serious
uneasiness
if
he
had
been
able
to
guess
by
what
unknown
dangers
he
was
surrounded
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
under
the
command
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
took
up
their
quartered
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
but
,
as
we
know
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
possessed
with
ambition
to
enter
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
had
formed
but
few
friendships
among
his
comrades
,
and
he
felt
himself
isolated
and
given
up
to
his
own
reflections
.
As
to
fortune
,
he
had
made
-
he
,
humble
as
he
was
-
an
enemy
of
the
cardinal
;
that
is
to
say
,
of
a
man
before
whom
trembled
the
greatest
men
of
the
kingdom
,
beginning
with
the
king
.
This
enemy
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Now
,
these
reflections
had
led
him
further
than
he
intended
,
and
the
day
was
beginning
to
decline
when
,
by
the
last
ray
of
the
setting
sun
,
he
thought
he
saw
the
barrel
of
a
musket
glitter
from
behind
a
hedge
.
This
was
evidently
an
ambuscade
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
up
with
a
bound
,
and
at
the
same
instant
the
ball
from
the
other
musket
tore
up
the
gravel
on
the
very
spot
on
the
road
where
he
had
thrown
himself
with
his
face
to
the
ground
.
He
immediately
,
therefore
,
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
toward
the
camp
,
with
the
swiftness
of
the
young
men
of
his
country
,
so
renowned
for
their
agility
;
but
whatever
might
be
his
speed
,
the
first
who
fired
,
having
had
time
to
<UNK>
,
fired
a
second
shot
,
and
this
time
so
well
aimed
that
it
struck
his
hat
,
and
carried
it
<NUMBER>
paces
from
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
his
hat
,
examined
the
hole
made
by
the
ball
,
and
shook
his
head
.
This
might
be
a
kind
remembrance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
might
be
a
vengeance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
that
was
most
probable
.
And
that
you
should
fail
me
!
''
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
well
suspected
that
that
which
was
deferred
was
not
relinquished
.
The
guards
were
under
arms
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
his
place
in
the
midst
of
his
comrades
.
``

about

who
shall
accomplish
it
;
and
I
made
you
a
sign
in
order
that
you
might
hold
yourself
in
readiness
.
''
The
matter
was
to
ascertain
,
by
<UNK>
,
how
the
enemy
guarded
this
bastion
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
raising
his
sword
.
D'Artagnan
set
out
with
his
<NUMBER>
companions
,
and
followed
the
trench
;
the
<NUMBER>
Guards
marched
abreast
with
him
,
and
the

soldiers
followed
behind
.
At
the
turning
of
the
<UNK>
they
found
themselves
within
about
<NUMBER>
paces
of
the
bastion
.
A
longer
stay
in
this
dangerous
spot
would
have
been
useless
imprudence
.
The
other
,
who
was
safe
and
sound
,
continued
his
way
toward
the
camp
.
The
idea
of
the
<NUMBER>
soldiers
who
had
abandoned
him
occurred
to
his
mind
,
and
with
them
he
remembered
the
assassins
of
<NUMBER>
evenings
before
.
As
he
might
be
only
wounded
and
might
denounce
their
crime
,
they
came
up
to
him
with
the
purpose
of
making
sure
.
<NUMBER>
of
them
took
his
gun
by
the
barrel
,
and
used
it
as
he
would
a
club
.
The
conflict
was
not
long
;
the
wretch
had
nothing
to
defend
himself
with
but
his
discharged
<UNK>
.
cried
the
bandit
.
``
Yes

``

proposed

said
the

,
laughing
,
``

I
am
worth

``
What

that

''
How
can
I
go

fetch

under

cried
the
bandit
,
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
and
leaning
upon
his
hand
-
for
he
began
to
lose
his
strength
with
his
blood
.
``
You
see
,
then

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
that

``
I

will
go

<PROPER_NOUN>
where
you
are
;
I
will
go
myself
.
''
A
slight
shock
,
the
dull
noise
of
<NUMBER>
balls
which
penetrated
the
flesh
,
a
last
cry
,
a
convulsion
of
agony
,
proved
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
the
<UNK>
assassin
had
saved
his
life
.
He
left
the
box
and
dice
where
they
fell
,
threw
the
purse
to
the
wounded
man
,
and
eagerly
opened
the
pocketbook
.
Nevertheless
it
was
plain
the
letter
came
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
anguish
.
Then
the
young
man
tremblingly
comprehended
what
a
terrible
thirst
for
vengeance
urged
this
woman
on
to
destroy
him
,
as
well
as
all

loved

and
how
well
she
must
be
acquainted

had
discovered
all

This
idea
completely
restored
clemency
to
his
heart
.
``
You
have
my
word
,
''
said
he
;
``
for
the
second
time
I
give
you
your

<PROPER_NOUN>
explained
the
sword
wound
of
his
companion
by
a
sortie
which
he
improvised
.
Besides
this
,
as
every
great
action
bears
its
recompense
with
it
,
the
brave
exploit
of
D'Artagnan
resulted
in
the

Meantime

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after

created

They
think

on

Of
this

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
poured

scarcely
were

out

In

the

impatient

The

No

the

had
consequently
sent

out

A

enveloped

came
out
immediately

exchanged
some

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
drunk
with

roaring
on
the

that

that

She
calculated

cross
this
corner
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
return
to
the

it
would
take
her
at
least
<NUMBER>
days

She
allowed
the
vessel
to
pass
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
repeating
her
request
to
the
captain
,
who
,
on
his
part
,
took
care
not
to
remind
her
of
it
.
At
the
end
of
the
jetty
,
his
clothes
richly
laced
with
gold
,
glittering
,
as
was
customary
with
him
,
with
diamonds
and
precious
stones
,
his
hat
ornamented
with
a
white
feather
which
<UNK>
upon
his
shoulder
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
seen
surrounded
by
a
staff
almost
as
brilliant
as
himself
.
They
entered
the
<UNK>
;
but
as
they
drew
near
in
order
to
cast
anchor
,
a
little
<UNK>
,
looking
like
a

<UNK>
armed
,
approached
the
merchant
vessel
and
dropped
into
the
sea
a
boat
which
directed
its
course
to
the

.
When
this
species

summons
was
made
the

inquired
aloud
the
point
of
the

departure
,
its
route
,
its
<UNK>
;
and
to
all
these
questions
the

replied
without

and
without
hesitation
.
The
boat
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
,
a
speck
near
the
enormous
mass
.
He
was
of
pale
complexion
,
with
clear
blue
eyes
,
rather
deeply
set
;
his
mouth
,
fine
and
well
cut
,
remained
motionless
in
its
correct
lines
;
his
chin
,
strongly
marked
,
denoted
that
strength
of
will
which
in
the
ordinary
<PROPER_NOUN>
type
<UNK>
mostly
nothing
but
obstinacy
;
a
brow
a
little
receding
,
as
is
proper
for
poets
,
<UNK>
,
and
soldiers
,
was
scarcely
shaded
by
short
thin
hair
which
,
like
the
beard
which
covered
the
lower
part

his
face
,
was
of
a

deep
chestnut
color

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that

so
courageous

shivered
in

``
Who

''
asked
she
,
``
who
has
the
kindness

trouble

so
particularly

These
words
were
pronounced
with
the
most
exact
politeness
and
the
most
perfect
calmness
.
<UNK>
the
hand
of
the
officer

she
began
the
descent

at

of
which

waited

to

A
carriage
was
in
waiting
.
``
The

far
away

Immediately
,
without
any
order
being
given
or
his
place
of
destination
indicated
,
the
coachman
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
plunged
into
the
streets
of
the
city
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
shuddered
.
This
threat
brought
no
reply

No
voice
replied
to
hers
;
the
carriage
continued
to
roll
on
with
rapidity
;
the
officer
seemed
a
statue
.
``
Take
care

said
the

coolly
,
``
you

``
No

``
None

I

The
carriage
passed
under
<NUMBER>
arched
<UNK>
,
and
at
length
stopped
in
a
court
large
,
dark
,
and
square
.
However
flattering
this
compliment
,
the
officer
made
no
reply
;
but
drawing
from
his
belt
a
little
silver
whistle
,
such
as
<UNK>
use
in
ships
of
war
,
he
whistled
<NUMBER>
times
,
with
<NUMBER>
different
<UNK>
.
They
then
came
to
a
massive
door
,
which
after
the
introduction
into
the
lock
of
a
key
which
the
young
man
carried
with
him
,
turned
heavily
upon
its
hinges
,
and
disclosed
the
chamber
destined
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
no
one
entered
except
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
who
brought
her
trunks
and
packages
,
deposited
them
in
a
corner
,
and
retired
without
speaking
.
``
In

cried
she
,
``

At
the
moment
a
great
jingling
of
spurs
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
He
was
without

hat
,
carried
a
sword
,
and
flourished
a

in
his
hand
.
``
Yes

Why
did
he
detain
her
?
This

appeared
to
her
most
reasonable
.
``
You
have

then

decided

Whatever

had
over

could
not
help
starting
;

as
in

de

placed
his

upon

knew

the

negligently
.

demanded

with
a

terror

continued
she
,
pressing
with
her
stiffened

the
<NUMBER>
arms
of
her
easy
chair
,
and
raising
herself
upon
her

.
``
Indeed

,

said
he
.
``
Perhaps
so

There
are
here
no
<UNK>
who
regulate
<UNK>
beforehand

However
,
he
continued
all
the

,
but
with
increasing
warmth
:
``
Yes

very
well
understand

it

my

Oh

be
assured
,
if
the
memory

you
should

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
with
an
attention
that
dilated
her
inflamed
eyes
.
Even
if
you
gained
the
yard
,
there
would
still
be
<NUMBER>
iron
gates
for

Ah

I

an

before

some

occur

Ah

try

What
do
you
say
of
him
?
if
you
succeed
with
him
,
I
pronounce
you
the

''
There
followed
between
these
<NUMBER>
personages
a
strange
silence
,
during
which
the
sound
of
a
slow
and
regular
step
was
heard
approaching
.
``
Now
,
''
said
the
baron
,
``
look
at
this
woman
.
She
will
try
to
seduce
you

perhaps
she

hold
this

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
put

in

''
``
She
is
not
to
leave
this
chamber
,

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
continued
the
baron
.
``
And
now
,
madame
,
try
to
make
your
peace
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
you
are
judged
by

!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
for
some
minutes
in
the
same
position
,
for
she
thought
they
might
perhaps
be
examining
her
through
the
keyhole
;
she
then
slowly
raised
her
head
,
which
had
resumed
its
formidable
expression
of
menace
and
defiance
,
ran
to
the
door
to
listen
,
looked
out
of
her
window
,
and
returning
to
bury
herself
again
in
her
large
armchair
,
she
reflected
.
As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
begun
the
siege
,
he
left
to
the
cardinal
the
task
of
finishing
it
.
In
<NUMBER>
case
or
the
other
,
the
trial
was
soon
over
.
This
amused
him
sometimes
a
little
,
and
made
him
endure
the
siege
with
patience
;
but
it
did
not
prevent
his
getting
very
tired
,
or
from
talking
at
every
moment
of
returning
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
so
that
if
the
messengers
and
the
spies
had
failed
,
his
Eminence
,
notwithstanding
all
his
<UNK>
,
would
have
found
himself
much
embarrassed
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
had
no
hope
but
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
question
of
carrying
the
city
by
assault
,
though
often
<UNK>
in
the
council
of
the
king
,
had
been
always
<UNK>
.
The
cardinal
could
not
drive
from
his
mind
the
fear
he
entertained
of
his
terrible
emissary
-
for
he
comprehended
the
strange
qualities
of
this
woman
,
sometimes
a
serpent
,
sometimes
a
lion
.
That
was
what
he
could
not
know
.
He
continued
to
press
the
raising
of
the
famous
dyke
which
was
to
starve
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
These
leaders
had
corn
in
abundance
,
and
would
not
let
them
partake
of
it
;
they
adopted
as
a
maxim
-
for
they
,
too
,
had
<UNK>
-
that
it
was
of
very
little
consequence
that
women
,
children
,
and
old
men
should
die
,
so
long
as
the
men
who
were
to
defend
the
walls
remained
strong
and
<UNK>
.
But
at
the
moment
when
the
cardinal
saw
his
means
already
<UNK>
,
and
<UNK>
himself
for
having
put
it
in
action
,
an
inhabitant
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
had
contrived
to
pass
the
royal
lines
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
knows
how
,
such
was
the
watchfulness
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
themselves
watched
over
by
the
cardinal
-
an
inhabitant
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
we
say
,
entered
the
city
,
coming
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
saying
that
he
had
seen
a
magnificent
fleet
ready
to
sail
within
<NUMBER>
days
.
This
unexpected
circumstance
brought
back
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
former
anxiety
,
and
forced
him
in
spite
of
himself
once
more
to
turn
his
eyes
to
the
other
side
of
the
sea
.
Sometimes
when
the
cardinal
,
always
on
horseback
,
like
the
lowest
<UNK>
of
the
army
,
cast
a
pensive
glance
over
those
works
,
so
slowly
keeping
pace
with
his
wishes
,
which
the
<UNK>
,
brought
from
all
the
corners
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
were
executing
under
his
orders
,
if
he
met
a
Musketeer
of
the
company
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
drew
near
and
looked
at
him
in
a
peculiar
manner
,
and
not
recognizing
in
him
<NUMBER>
of
our
<NUMBER>
companions
,
he
turned
his
penetrating
look
and
profound
thoughts
in
another
direction
.
This
letter
was
so
important
that
it
made
them
forsake
their
cards
and
their
dice
on
the
<UNK>
.
<UNK>
a
sign
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
stop
,
he
alighted
from
his
horse
,
and
went
toward
these
suspected
merry
companions
,
hoping
,
by
means
of
the
sand
which
deadened
the
sound
of
his
steps
and
of
the
hedge
which
concealed
his
approach
,
to
catch
some
words
of
this
conversation
which
appeared
so
interesting
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
therefore
added
nothing
to
his
speech
,
but
contented
himself
with
pointing
his
<UNK>
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
hedge
,
announcing
by
this
gesture
the
cardinal
and
his
escort
.
``
Are
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
expected
by
land
,
or
do
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
consider
themselves
superior
officers

''
``
<UNK>
who
have
the
order

warn
their

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
forward
and
stammered
out
a
few
words
of
gratitude
which
soon
expired
under
the
gloomy
looks
of
the
cardinal
.
Then
he
resumed
in
his
turn
:
``
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
has
,
I
hope
,
in
no
way
been
forgotten

And
he
showed
the
cardinal
,
with
his
finger
,
the
<NUMBER>
muskets
piled
near
the
drum
,
on
which
were
the
cards

said
the
cardinal
.

``
Thus

are
ready
to

``

In

<PROPER_NOUN>

no

Before

to

she
had
pondered

<UNK>

turned
on
all
sides

examined
on
all
points

the

the

anxious

the
result
was
that
<PROPER_NOUN>

everything

appeared

As

he
fears

In

still

out

glance
cast
upon

revealed
to

all

mute

motionless

his

spoken

added
she

pointing
to
the

She
appeared
to
be
in
ecstasy
,
and
did
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
what
was
going
on
around
her
.
She
arose
,
came
to
the
table
,
ate
but
little

and
drank
only
water

She
allowed
,
therefore
,
half
an
hour
to
pass
away
;
and
as
at
that

all
was
silence
in
the
old
castle

as
nothing

heard

the
eternal

that

with

began
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
then
able
to
judge
of
the
effect
she
had
produced
.

is
as
dismal

if
besides
the

hear
such

these
,
no

can
hold
out

Did
anybody
order
you
to
prevent
that

singing

flies

kill
her

believed

heard
the
singing
of
the
angel

consoled
the
<NUMBER>

the
<UNK>
.

have
perhaps
offended
you
in
your

but
it
was
without
wishing
to
do
so

I
swear

The
poor
,
senseless
young
man
was
not
aware
of
the
<UNK>
of
his
words

while

was
reading
with
her

eyes
the
very
depths

his
heart

``
You
have
done
right

Lieutenant

said
the
soldier
.
Still
more
must
be
done

In
short
,
she
studied
everything
,
as
a
skillful
<UNK>
does
to
whom
a
new
part
has
been
assigned
in
a
line
to
which
he
is
not
accustomed
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
see
all
;
perhaps
he
would
say
nothing
,
but
he
would
see
.
It
was
a
tolerably
fine
winter
's
day
,
and
a
ray
of
that
pale
<PROPER_NOUN>
sun
which
lights
but
does
not
warm
came
through
the
bars
of
her
prison
.
The
prisoner
made
no
reply
.
Patience

patience

cried
the
baron
;
``
your

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs

Besides

repentance
becomes
the
guilty

Someone

in

Milady
remained
silent

only
this

went
out

A

idea

however

rushed
into

not

Soon
after
she
heard
lighter
steps
than
those
of
the
sentinel

came
from

stopped
before

darted
from

seated

taking
an

of
the

rope
which
by

opened

As
for

she
returned
to
her

with
a

savage

repeated

that
terrible

by

It

not

done

men
prompt
to
let
themselves
be
seduced

whom
the
gallant
education

<UNK>

brain
plans
so

grows
with

She
did
not
invoke
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
we
very
well

she
had
faith
in
the
genius

evil

that
immense
sovereignty

reigns
in
all
the
details
of
human
life

and
by
which

as

a

Like
all
persons
of
real
genius

<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
what
suited
her
nature

the

these
were

She

took
back
the

laid
it
upon

had
agreed
with

The

stood
upright
before

multiplied
around

Although

a

seized

I
tried

struggle
against

I
stretched
out
my
arms

I
fell
upon
<NUMBER>
knee
,
then
upon
both

The
only

I
recollect
is
that
I
awoke
in
bed
in

round
chamber
,
the
furniture
of
which
was
sumptuous

and
into
which
light
only
penetrated
by

My

appeared
to
strive
in

to
shake
off
the
heavy
darkness
of
the
sleep
from
which
I
could
not
rouse
myself

My

were
near

on

;
I
neither

myself
nor
going

It

``
Certainly

you

easily
comprehend

<PROPER_NOUN>

that
the

I
sank
exhausted
with

terror
into
an
armchair

Although

had
eaten
nothing

my

A

the

I

Half

I
contended

instead

asleep

I
sank
into

a

with

without

however

<PROPER_NOUN>
lowered
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
being
informed
of
this

packed
his

as
without

he
knew
the
great
desire

even
imperative

which
his

it
goes
without

therefore
had
written

I
salute

<PROPER_NOUN>
To
this
letter
was
added
an
order

conceived
in
these
terms
:
At
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
,
<NUMBER>
The
superior

who
shall
present
this
note
to
her
the
novice
who
entered
the
convent
upon
my
recommendation
and
under
my
patronage

Therefore
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
going
to
ask
leave
of
absence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
confiding
to
him
candidly
the
importance
of
his

when
the
news
was
transmitted
to
him
as
well
as
to
his

friends
that

about

set
out
for

with
an
escort
of
<NUMBER>

and
that
they
formed
part
of
the
escort
.
The
king
,
however
,
who
sought
distraction
,
while
traveling
as
fast
as
possible
-
for
he
was
anxious
to
be
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
by
the
twenty-third
-
stopped
from
time
to
time
to
fly
the

,
a
pastime
for
which
the
taste
had
been
formerly
inspired
in
him
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
for
which
he
had
always
preserved
a

The
king
thanked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
permitted
him
to
distribute
<UNK>
for
<NUMBER>
days

on
condition
that
the
favored

should
not
appear

under

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who

as
we

never

Well

once
returned
from

half
by

half
through

We

We

I

that
with

we

be
in
sufficient

what
do
you
fear

''
On
the
evening
of
the
<UNK>
,
as
they
were
entering
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
as
D'Artagnan
was
dismounting
at
the
inn
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
,
a
horseman
came
out
of
the
post
yard
,
where
he
had
just
had
a
relay
,
started
off
at
a
gallop
,
and
with
a
fresh
horse
took
the
road
to

.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Well

where

are
you
going
now

let

overtake
him

``
He

I
recognized
him

the

blew
upon
his

``

''
``
My

``

that

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
the
<NUMBER>
friends
flew
at
a
gallop
along
the
road
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
When
landing
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
an
<PROPER_NOUN>
whom
the
persecutions
of
the
French
drove
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
when
landing
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
a
<NUMBER>
days
'
passage
,
she
passed
for
a
<UNK>
whom
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
persecuted
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
out
of
their
hatred
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

His

<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
<UNK>
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
overtook
her
;
she
stopped
,
and
slept
at
an
inn
.
The
abbess
assigned
her
a
chamber
,
and
had
breakfast
served
.
There
is
very
little
amusement
in
the
cloister
,
and
the
good
superior
was
eager
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
her
new
boarder
.
The
abbess
,
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
noble
house
,
took
particular
delight
in
stories
of
the
court
,
which
so
seldom
travel
to
the
extremities
of
the
kingdom
,
and
which
,
above
all
,
have
so
much
difficulty
in
penetrating
the
walls
of
<UNK>
,
at
whose
threshold
the
noise
of
the
world
dies
away
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
however
,
saw
that
this
sort
of
narrative
amused
her
very
much
,
and
kept
at
it
;
only
she
now
let
her
conversation
<UNK>
toward
the
cardinal
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
think
she
should
soon
grow
weary
of
a
convent
life
;
she
resolved
,
then
,
to
risk
something
in
order
that
she
might
know
how
to
act
afterward
.
If
she
is
a
cardinalist
,
she
has
no
fanaticism
,
at
least
.
Milady
therefore
continued
,
coloring
her
<UNK>
more
and
more
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
oh

my

to
discover
something

vein

''
As
for
me
,
I
shall
be
deceived
all
my
life
perhaps
,
but
I
shall
always
have
faith
in
a
person
whose
countenance
inspires
me
with
sympathy
.
''
``
At
what
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
.
``
But
this
letter
in
which
he
<UNK>
you
to

''
Do
you
believe
there
is
a
spot
on
the
earth
which
the
cardinal
can
not
reach
if
he
takes
the
trouble
to
stretch
forth
his

?
``
Ah

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
if

she
is
not
altogether
wretched

``
You

Oh

no

She

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
``
That

There
was
connected
with
the
remembrance
of
this
girl
a
remembrance
of
anger
;
and
a
desire
of
vengeance
disordered
the
features
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
,
however
,
immediately
recovered
the
calm
and
benevolent
expression
which
this
woman
of
a

had
for
a
moment
allowed
them
to
lose

But
you
have
been
traveling
these
<NUMBER>
days
,
as
you
told
me
yourself
.
During
the
last
<NUMBER>
days
she
had
experience
so
many
an
such
various
emotions
that
if
her
frame
of
iron
was
still
capable
of
supporting
fatigue
,
her
mind
required
repose
.
<NUMBER>
thing
alone
frightened
her
;
that
was
the
remembrance
of
her
husband
,
the

la
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
she
had
believed
dead
,
or
at

<UNK>
,
and
whom
she
found
again
in
<UNK>
best
friend
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
opened
her
eyes
,
and
saw
the
abbess
,
accompanied
by
a
young
woman
with
light
hair
and
delicate
complexion
,
who
fixed
upon
her
a
look
full
of
benevolent
curiosity
.
It
is
true
that
the
habit
of
a
novice
,
which
the
young
woman
wore
,
was
not
very
advantageous
in
a
contest
of
this
kind
.
``
How
,
madame
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
scarcely
seen

you

The

sat
down

``
How

you
are
going
soon

''
``
What
I
have
heard

Are

But

you
appear

be

continued
the
novice
;
``
and
if
you

fly
it
only
rests
with
yourself
to
do
so

``
Hear

the

answered
the

words
of
the
Musketeer
by
pointing

In
a

a
night
watch
passed
.
There
he
again
appeared
uneasy
and
embarrassed
,
and
stopped
for
the
third

<PROPER_NOUN>
went
toward
the
house
,
while

left

<NUMBER>

There
were
large

filled
with

ticketed
according

dried

shone
like

set
in

hung
down
in

But
scarcely
had
he
expressed
his
request
when
the
unknown
,
who
remained
standing
before
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

drew
back
with
signs
of
terror
,
and
refused

He
arose
,
bowed

went
out

returned
by
the

he
came
,
re-entered
the

and
went
to

As

they
had
heard
no

only

on

could
be
traced

On

listened

and
mingled
their

without
seeing
the

or
being
seen
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
the
road
for
some

,
his

fixed
upon

slight

At

guided

A

the

burst

after

By

heard

rose

The

In

But
this

instead

jumped

This

remained
standing

''
It
was
in
the
hotels
that
the
surprise
of
the
news
brought
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
most
<UNK>
felt
.
All
the
servants
of
the
castle
,
under
the
inspection
of
the
officers
,
were
sent
into
the
city
in
quest
of

<NUMBER>
horsemen
were
dispatched
to

seek

for
fish
,
and
to
the
gardens

for
fruits
and
flowers
.
Next
the
music
was
to
be
provided
;
drawers
were
emptied
;
the
<UNK>
did
a
glorious
trade
in
wax
,
ribbons
,
and
<UNK>
;
<UNK>
laid
in
stores

meat

In
the

at
scarcely
a
<NUMBER>
paces
from
the
Castle
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>

between
the

in
a
sufficiently
handsome
street

then
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
which
must

in
fact
,
have
been
very

stood
a
venerable
edifice

with
pointed

of

large
dimensions

ornamented
with
<NUMBER>
windows
looking

with

with

However
that
may
be
,
the
good
lady
must
have
stepped
with
a
circumspect
foot
over
the
threshold
of
this
building
.
There
he
established
a
little
hostelry
,
in
which
was
<UNK>
a
macaroni
so
delicious
that
people
came
from
miles
round
to
fetch
it
or
eat
it
.
This
double
favor
,
of
a
<UNK>
and
a
macaroni
,
conferred
upon
the
<UNK>
house
,
gave
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
fancy
to
grace
his
hostelry
with
a
pompous
title
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
younger
,
like
a
man
of
good
heart
,
supported
the
loss
with
resignation
,
and
the
gain
without
insolence
.
He
was
an
old
Italian
,
a
rival
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
an
unfortunate
rival
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
his
character
of
a
compatriot
,
was
indulgent
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
was
the
name
of
the
artist
.
As
he
grew
old
he
attached
himself
to
the
son
as
he
had
done
to
the
father
,
and
by
degrees
became
a

in
which
his
remarkable

his
acknowledged
sobriety

useless

gave
him
an

place
by

with

inspection
over
the
domestics

Pittrino
was
puffed
up
with
all
the
joy

You
must
efface
either
the

without

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
downcast
and
said
he
felt
assured

what

about

happen
.
``
No

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
make
amends
to
his
<UNK>
,
hung
up
the
<UNK>
of
the
preceding
sign
in
his
bedroom
,
which
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
blush
every
time
she
looked
at
it

when
she
was
<UNK>
at
night

It
was
not
an
immense
fortune
that

had
in
<UNK>

but
he
might
hope
to
double
the
<NUMBER>
louis
<UNK>
left
by
his
father
,
to
make
another

louis
by
the
sale
of
his
house
and
stock
,
and
at
length
to
live
happily
like
a
retired

This
was
a
man
of
scarcely
<NUMBER>
years
of
age
,
handsome
,
tall

austere

or
rather
melancholy
,
in
all
his
gestures

To
ascertain
this

there
was
no

consult
anything
but
his

long

slender

and
white

of
which
every
muscle

every
vein
,
became
apparent
through
the
skin
at
the

movement
,
and
eloquently
spoke
of
good
descent

Now
,
from
the
time
he
had
arrived
,
this
gentleman
had
scarcely
touched
any
repast
that
had
been
served
up
to
him
in
his
chamber

In
this

he
had
seen
the

return
from
hunting

then
had
again

The

concluded

He
struck
the
bag
of
pistoles
with
his
clenched

as
he
spoke
,
and
it
fell
heavily
to
the

On
arriving
beneath

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
the

a

was
already

It
was
with
the
eyes
of
the
king
as

azure

,
or
with
those
more
terrific

almost

which

<UNK>
under

in

a

in

heaven
delights

reflect
sometimes
its

It
must

be

that
when

in

chairs

concealed

<PROPER_NOUN>

The
king
remarked
that
his

and
he
scarcely
knew
the
names

any
of
the
persons
who
were
presented
to
them
;
whilst
the

,
on

never
failed

with

to

some

a

<PROPER_NOUN>
alone

that

<PROPER_NOUN>

who

observed

haughty

calm

spoke
thus
;
while

<PROPER_NOUN>

jumped
by

a

above
the

of

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at

smiled
sadly

``

,
with

The

smiled

Our

made

He
came
up
just
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
terminated
by
saying
:

It
was
not

it
appeared

that
the

met
those

all

he
perceived

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

pale

resolved

had
just
manifested
by
the
order

arose
from

took
a

towards
the

.
A

stole
over
the
lips
of
the
minister
,
who
appeared
,
by
a
bend
of
the
head
,
to
give
the

permission

The

passed

all
the

stood

to

This

escorted
the

The

all
appeared

sleep

Besides

to

he
had
nothing

No

And
the

without

This

added
he
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``

be

``
Here
am
I

''
replied
he
.
And
he
went
into
the
king

apartment
.
The
lieutenant
bowed
his
head
with
military
politeness
and
replied
,
``
I
am
,
sire
.
''
``
How
can
that
be
,
monsieur
?
''
At
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
it
is
very
different
,
and
if
I
were
at
the
Louvre
I
should
rely
upon
my
brigadier
;
but
,
when
traveling
,
sire
,
no
one
knows
what
may
happen
,
and
I
prefer
doing
my

myself

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

I
can
not
allow
that

I
will
have
you
rest

``
I
say
,

,
that
I
will
not
expose
myself
to
the
chance
of
a
fault
.
``
Eh
!
The
king
cut
short
the
conversation
by
a
fresh
question
.
The
king
walked
several
times
up
and
down
his
chamber
;
it
was
very
plain
that
he
burned
with
a
desire
to
speak
,
but
that
he
was
restrained
by
some
fear
or
other
.
The
king
continued
to
walk
about
,
casting
from
time
to
time
a
side
glance
at
the
lieutenant
.
``
I
am
here
,
sire
.
''
``
I
?
''
A
servant
who
has
nothing
but
ears
is
not
half
a
good
servant
.
''
``
My
eyes
are
good
,
though
,
sire
,
although
they
have
served
their
master
long
and
much
:
when
they
have
anything
to
see
,
they
seldom
miss
the
opportunity
.
I
could
then
no
longer
hesitate
.
The
king
turned
away
to
smile
;
then
,
after
a
few
seconds
,
he
again
fixed
his
limpid
eye
upon
that
countenance
,
so
intelligent
,
so
bold
,
and
so
firm
,
that
it
might
have
been
said
to
be
the
proud
and
energetic
profile
of
the
eagle
facing
the
sun
.
he
will
not
speak
!
''
<UNK>
for
having
been
less
of
a
fool
than
another
might
have
been
.
''
asked
he
,
in
a
tone
we
can
not
describe
,
but
which
,
without
appearing
to
solicit
the
royal
confidence
,
contained
so
much
persuasive
frankness
,
that
the
king
immediately
replied
:
``
Yes
,
but
draw
near
,
monsieur
.
''
``
You
will
mount
on
horseback
to-morrow
,
at

and
you

a

saddled

''
Is
that
all
?
''
``
Shall
I
come
to
seek
your

,
or
shall
I
wait

''
The
lieutenant
bowed
,
understanding
that
the
king
had
told
him
all
he
had
to
say
.
``
Come
,
he
has
begun
,
''
said
he
.
Oh
!
After
this
exclamation
,
the
officer
arose
and
marched
,
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
<UNK>
,
about
the
immense
ante-chamber
that
served
him
as
an
apartment
.
said
he
,
``
I
am
mistaken

particularly

how
do
I
get

They

the

went
so

whether
such

But
let

pass

And
upon
this
recommendation
,
made
to
himself
,
he
folded
his
cloak
around
him
,
looking
with
contempt
upon
his
royal
neighbor
.
He
did
not
disturb
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
was
sleeping
soundly
at
some
distance
;
he
dressed
himself
,
and
the
valet
,
in
a
great
fright
sprang
up
,
thinking
he
had
been
deficient
in
his
duty
;
but
the
king
sent
him
back
again
,
commanding
him
to
preserve
the
most
absolute
silence
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
bridle
:
the
officer
held
the
stirrup
without
dismounting
,
and
asked
his
majesty
's
orders
in
a
low
voice
.
I
will
wait
here

''
``
It
will
bear
,
in

,
the
arms

''
Behind
this
carriage
came
another
.
``
That
is
well
,
''
replied
the
king
in
an
agitated
voice
.
said
he
,
as
he
rode
on
,
``

There
were

all

At

the
effect
of
which
he
watched
closely
,
the

with
the
black
eyes
uttered
a
cry
of

,
leant
out
of

and
seeing
the

approaching

held
out
her

exclaiming
:
``

The

offered

On

the

much

carried

to

and
stifled
a

And

took
a

away

As

the

hid

in

When

like

had
long

When

As
D'Artagnan
delighted

both
from
pleasure

system

in
making
people
talk
about
things

interested
him

he
fenced
in
his

with
<PROPER_NOUN>

it
was
pure

beyond

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
on
his
side

was
on

afforded
nothing

to
the
curiosity

<PROPER_NOUN>

so
that
our
musketeer
,
in
a
tolerably
bad

desired
to
go
to

as
soon

he
had
supped
.
Since
he
was
no

in

any

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
promised
himself
to
indulge
in
sleeping
as
soundly
as

had
formerly
slept
lightly
;
but
with
whatever
good

D'Artagnan
had
made
himself
this
promise
,
and
whatever
desire
he
might
have
to
keep
it
religiously
,
he
was
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
loud
noise
of
carriages

and
servants
on
horseback

``
<UNK>
monsieur

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

``
And
all
those

And
he
returned
to
his
bed
,
asking
himself
how
<PROPER_NOUN>
always
contrived
to
be
protected
by
the
most
powerful
personages
in
the
kingdom

Formerly
he
said
,
``
Mordioux
!

I
have
still
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
left
,
and
there
I
shall
find
the
best

At
a
distance
he
perceived
the
Castle

of

which
,
having
become
part

These

were
addressed

He
had
all

changed

was

this

it
was
about

visits
that

received
from
that
somber

before

got
sight
of
the
sea
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
then
these
visits
were
indeed
but
short
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
proposed

of

By

passengers
came
suddenly
from

on

The

were
watching

anxiety
the

from

bristling

D'Artagnan
recognized

in

fell

rolled
about

<NUMBER>

rather
than
take

another

jumped
upon

as

<UNK>
by

All
at
once
his
attention
was
called
to
a
particular
part
of
the
room
.
This
man
became
pale
,
without
its
being
to
be
discerned
whether
his
pallor
arose
from
anger
or
from
fear
;
seeing
which
,
the
sailor
concluded
it
was
from
fear
,
and
raised
his
fist
with
the
manifest
intention
of
letting
it
fall
upon
the
head
of
the
stranger
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
<NUMBER>
indifferent
spectators
at
the
door
turned
round
with
frowning
brows
,
<UNK>
their
evident
intention

taking
the

in

rear

if

enemy
did
not
cease
their

The
floor
was
already
strewn
with

filled
with
cries

dust
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
satisfied
with
the
test
,
advanced
,
sword
in
hand
,
and
striking
with
the
pommel
every
head
that
came
in
his
way
,
he
uttered
a
vigorous
hola

then
demanded
he
of
the
assembly
,
with
the
majestic
tone
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
pronouncing
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
loaded
with

by

It
was
not
till
he
had
arrived
at

hollow
part

the
deepest
down
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
to
see
them
<UNK>
,
turned
towards
them
,
making
a
friendly
sign
with
his
hand
.
After
this
examination
they
turned
their
eyes
towards
their
leader
,
who
had
long
been
acquainted
with
the
art
of
speaking
to
men
of
that
class

and
who
improvised
the

pronounced
with
an
energy
truly

out

it

to
what

us

it
is
therefore
necessary

be

The
thing
which
puzzles
me
is
taking
with
me
a

which
crew
will
annoy
me
immensely

whilst
if

by

there
were

``
Oh

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
never
said
more
than
there
was
need
to
say
,
in
order
to
leave
people
in
doubt

The
latter
did
not
lie
much
more
than
the
first

for
he
had
rowed
on
board
his
majesty

galleys
<NUMBER>
years

enjoined
his

the
coast
which
leads

others
the

These
men
had
not
entirely
lost
all
ideas
of
civilization
,
and
under
proper
garments
their
hearts
would
beat
again
.
He
confessed
to
them
that
the
object
was
not
to
learn
to
what
extent
the
French
merchants
were
injured
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
smuggling
,
but
to
learn
how
far
French

could
annoy
English
trade

A
fortnight
after
all
we
have
said
had
taken
place
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
whole
troop
assembled
at
the

D'Artagnan
recognized

and
absorb
upon
his
pale
countenance
the

already
cut
by

While

thus
occupied
with

which
governed
itself

alone

and
which

everything

left
empty

upon

never

The

watched
the

That
was
the
center
of
all
his
operations

there
collected
around
him
all

friends
,
and
all
the
people
of
the
lower
class
,
eternally
inclined

He
got
together

therefore

his

formidable
at

for
its
composition

and
hastened

like

advanced

listening

the

came
from

It

been
thought

such
a
noise
in
the
streets

had
set
out

hoisted
before
them
not
only
a
standard

but
still
further

a

it
might
have
been
believed

that

had
begun

that

were
less
good

probably
with

were
forced
from

forever
to
relieve

from

Monk
quite
as
hungry
as
his
people

but
affecting
perfect
indifference
for
the
absent
mutton

cut
a
fragment
of
tobacco
,
half
an
inch
long
,
from
the
<UNK>
of
a
sergeant
who
formed
part
of
his
suite

and
began
to

the

assuring
his

Nevertheless

in
the

covered
with
long

rushes

were

plainly
to

after

Monk
approached

There

<PROPER_NOUN>
colored
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
path
by

had
come
to
his

soon
caressed
the

at

from

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened

they
found
themselves

reposed

came

However
firm
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
.
Monk
allowed
a
murmur
of
surprise
to
escape
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
a
profound
sigh
.
cried
he
,
``

bowed
to

Monk
followed

his

embarked
with

During

passage

Monk
only
spoke
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
in

urgent

Now
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
plenty
of
time
for
reflection

he
battered
his

during

had
seen
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

how
he
had
conspired

how

had
entered
<PROPER_NOUN>

camp
;
and
the
poor
lieutenant

musketeers
plucked
a
hair
from
his

every

reflected
that
the
horseman
who
accompanied
<PROPER_NOUN>
on

have
been

The

was
making
fair
way
up

tolerably
wide
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

desired

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
boat
set
him
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
upon
the
muddy
bank
,
amidst
the
reeds
.
Monk
raised
his
eyes
,
and
perceived
there
was
,
in
fact
,
a
house
which
the
flames
were
beginning
to
devour
.
It
was
doubtless
this
menacing
occupation
which
had
made
them
neglect
to
signal
the
felucca
.
These
words
contained
at

a
sorrow

an
apprehension

a

perfectly

the

flashed

The

An

<PROPER_NOUN>
found

with

appeared

all
remained

The

conducted
himself
like

the
art

flattery

he
admired
all

he
<UNK>
very
pleasantly
upon

very

sufficient

would
perhaps
remain
faithful
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
if
it
would
not
be
more
expedient
to
terminate
the
quarrel
by
an

They
remembered

the

with

too
salt

not

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
no
more
inclination

support
parliament

but
he
had
it
inscribed
on

so
that
all

reduced

ill

the

perceiving

<PROPER_NOUN>

every

found
the

The
day
that
the
deed
of
gift
had
been
sent
to
the
king
,
the
cardinal
caused
himself
to
be
transported
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
disease
,

had
become
worse

it

notwithstanding
the

with

constant
in

first
heard
this

,
and
transmitted
it
to
the

it
greatly
agitated

Nevertheless

as

felt
that
the
uncertainty
increased
his
torments
,
he
did
not

an

went
out
;
<PROPER_NOUN>

up

:

he

There
he
stopped

a
look
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
telling
him
that
he
was
on
a
wrong

of

stopped
several

This
announcement
produced
a
stir
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
advantage
to
escape
by
the
door
of
the
ruelle
.
An
usher
placed
an
armchair
close
to
the
bed
.
Silence
fell
upon
the
chamber
with
the
velvet
curtains
.
It
was
not
physical
pain
which
gave
him
that
air
of
<UNK>
,
and
that
lugubrious
look
;
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
thanks
that
were
about
to
issue
from
the
king
's
mouth
,
and
cut
off
all
hope
of
restitution

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
his
head
.

much
affected
,

<PROPER_NOUN>
still
more
than
his

from
very
different
motives

The
eyes
of
the

devoured
the
king
,
for
he
felt
the
great
moment
had
come

<PROPER_NOUN>
of

tears
flowed
afresh

Oh

no

that

``

the

aloud

read
the

in
his

``
Your

``
Yes

my

Ah

At
length
his

fell
upon
the
fragment
which
bore
his

and
recognizing
it
,
he
sunk
back
on
his
bolster
in
a
swoon
.
My

This

not
produce
all
the

His

by

became
fainter
;
and
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
the

they
ceased
altogether

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
so
low
a

that
the
breath

arrived
only
like
a

from

tomb
in
the
attentive

of
the
king

remained
for

bewildered

cried

warmly

``

The
young
king
felt
the
tears
rise
to
his
eyes
;
he
bent
over
the
dying
man
,
already
half
a
corpse
,
and
then
hastily
retired
.
Like
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
no
doubt
considered
the
world
a
great
stage
,
and
was
desirous
of
playing
out
the
last
act
of
the
comedy
.
Towards
midnight
,
while
still
painted
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mortal
agony
came
on
.
At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning

had
administered

The
king
,
on
learning
this

felt
as
if
a
cold
sweat
were
passing
over
his
brow
;
-
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
light
of
liberty
;
slavery
appeared
to
him
more
dark
and
less
acceptable
than
ever
.
A
third
time
the
nurse
returned
.
But
he
did
not
go
to
bed
for
that
hour
,
he
slept
in
a
fauteuil

``
Well

the

without

saying
to

:

The

he

at

sprang
through

commanding

It

taken
all

when
the
repeated
noise

several
slight
equal
knocks
struck
his

and
appeared
to
fix
his

It
was
a

glass
let
into
a
panel
.
``
Oh

And

without

to
respond

he
pulled
out

it
thrice

``
whence

Immediately
the

moved
like

discovered
a

rather
deep
,
in
which
the
superintendent
disappeared
as

going

This

under

perhaps

he
was
a

endowed

thought

That

which
our

had
observed

during
the

the

succeeded

at

it

have
opposed

That

I
cling
above

everything

the

I
not

She
owes
me
certainly
a

for
all

did
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
an

for
all
she
has
not

Only
the
nothing
of
to-day
is
the
all
of
former

;
there
has
only
this
little
change
taken
place
in
my

And
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
applied
his
hand
to
his
breast
,
as
if
he
were
actually
seeking
the
place
where
his
heart
was
.
``
Ah
!
And
what
is
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

when

Thus

vaguely
suspects
M.

I
know
it

I
could
prove

``
Now

continued
the
musketeer
,
``

These
reflections
were
the
only
impediments
which
were
able
to
retard
the
progress
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

From
that
moment
the
musketeer
travelled
on
post-horses

<UNK>
to

,
from
the

he
crossed

holding

that
which
brought

nearest
to
the

was
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
placed
on
his

a
calotte

velvet

and
over
the
calotte

a
large
black
hat
;
no
more
sword
,
a
stick
,
hung
by
a
cord
to
his
wrist
,
but
to
which
,
he
promised
himself
,
as
an
unexpected
auxiliary
,
to
join
,
upon
occasion
,
a
good
dagger
,
<NUMBER>
inches
long
,
concealed
under

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
traveled
,
then
,
pretty
easily
upon

,
who
<UNK>
like

<UNK>

and
who

a

upon
<NUMBER>
<UNK>

of

the
practiced
eye
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
appreciated
the
strength
and
safety
beneath
the
thick
mass
of
hair
which
covered
them
.
They
not
only
did
not
know
him
,
but
were
unwilling
to
know
him

Among
these
<UNK>
of
chateaux
and
<UNK>

the
most

the
richest

and
the
most
popular

<PROPER_NOUN>
learnt
all
this
without
appearing

astonished

to
sup
off
a

a

in
a
hotel
of

The

To

would
have

still
further

been

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
aware

himself

up

He
went
thither

with

An

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

that
the

certainly
did

``

``

aloud

addressing
the

``

the

But
there

an

``

Without

the

I

``
Ah

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

there
remained
nothing

but
a

that

But
the

At
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
at

<PROPER_NOUN>

with
his

animated
by
rough

and
a

approached
these

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

breaking
into

<UNK>
all
his

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

``
But

A
slight
shudder
crept
over
the
body
of
the
musketeer
.
said
the
fisherman
,
pointing
with
pride
to
his
pretty
<UNK>
bark
.
What
for

<PROPER_NOUN>

what

A

The
fishermen
,
who
<UNK>
their
occupation
as
they
proceeded
,
did
not
perceive
that
their
passenger
had
not
become
pale
,
neither
groaned
nor
suffered
;
that
in
spite
of
that
horrible
tossing
and
rolling
of
the
bark
,
to
which
no
hand
imparted
direction
,
the
novice
passenger
had
preserved
his
presence
of
mind
and
his
appetite
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
brought
them
good
luck
;
they
told
him
so
.
These
words
produced
the
same
effect
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
the
hissing
of
the
first
bullet
on
a
day
of
battle
;
he
let
go
of
both
line
and
<UNK>
,
which
,
dragging
each
other
,
returned
again
to
the
water
.
The
sun
darted
its
rays
of
gold
upon
the
sea
,
raising
a
shining
mist
round
this
enchanted
isle
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the
aspect
of
those
masses
of
black
rocks
,
``
these
are
fortifications

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
And
further
on

''
Ah

``
Mordioux

''
There
is
always
something
in
a
landing
,
if
it
be
only
from
the
smallest
<UNK>
-
a
trouble
and
a
confusion
which
do
not
leave
the
mind
the
liberty
of
which
it
stands
in
need
in
order
to
study
at
the
first
glance
the
new
locality
presented
to
it
.
The
smaller
stones
were
transported
to
the
shore
by
means
of
a
chain
formed
by
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
peasants
.
He
advanced
then
little
by
little
,
scarcely
going
beyond
the
line
formed
by
the
fishermen
on
the
beach
,
observing
everything
,
saying
nothing
,
and
meeting
all
suspicion
that
might
have
been
excited
with
a
<UNK>
question
or
a
polite
bow
.
By
the
side
of
each
of
these
batteries
other
workmen
were
<UNK>
<UNK>
filled
with
earth
,
the
lining
of
another
battery
.
These
fortifications
belonged
neither

the
Dutch
method

nor
to
the
French
method
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
to
the
system
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
skillful
engineer
,
who
about
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
previously
had
quitted
the
service
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
enter
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Otherwise
,
the
works
were
almost
complete
,
and
a
group
of
workmen
,
receiving
orders
from
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
conductor
of
the
works
,
were
occupied
in
placing
the
last
stones
.
This
group
was
<UNK>
by
the
man
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
already
remarked

and
who
appeared

be
the

He
<UNK>
in
the
most
majestic
manner

and
appeared

for
<PROPER_NOUN>
only
saw
his
back
,
to
be

the
workmen
for
their
idleness
and
want
of
strength
.
But
the
stone
had
already
twice
escaped
from
their
hands
before
gaining
a
sufficient
height
for
the
<UNK>
to
be
introduced
.
And
yet
,
when
the
<NUMBER>
men
were
bent
towards
the
stone
,
the
man
with
the
feathers
had
himself
,
with
a
powerful
voice
,
given
the
word
of
command
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
oh

''
stand
on
<NUMBER>
side
,
and
you
shall
see
how
this

to
be
done
.
''
The
workmen
,
as
commanded
by
the
engineer
,
drew
back
with
their
ears
down
,
and
shaking
their
heads
,
with
the
exception
of
the

who
held
the
plank

prepared

perform
the

cried
he
;

the
color
mounted
to
his

said
the
musketeer

What
they
wished

conceal

not
their

their

Less

thought
aloud

To
hesitate
in
his

would
have
been
a
check

for
which
the
self-love
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
never
have
consoled
itself

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
visibly
stupefied
with
the
argument

and
seeking
to
account
for
it
to
himself
,
with
the
felicity
of
deduction
we
know
to
be

to
him

``

``

By

his

returned
,
he
had
fixed
his
plans
for
the
campaign

``

Against

Suddenly

The

But
there

the

it

Malicorne
had
heard

pronounced
twice

he
was
delighted
at
having
an
opportunity
of
coming
to
a
conclusion
with

de

and
he
turned
round
:

replied
the

,
``

,
seemingly

''
And
upon
that
he
went
away
,
leaving
the
poor
lady
quite
disconcerted
.
but
I
must
get
through
as
well
as
I
can
;
my
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
does
nothing
for
nothing
.
''
At
that
moment
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
From
his
infancy
he
had
,
with
calculation
beyond
his
age
,
lent
his
name
and
complaisance
to
the
follies
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
sole
ambition
was
to
spend
money
.
The
mania
of
selling
his
new
clothes
for
a
quarter
of
what
they
were
worth
had
rendered
our
hero
sufficiently
celebrated
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
city
where
,
in
general
,
we
should
be
puzzled
to
say
why
he
came
to
pass
his
days
of
<UNK>
.
But
,
quite
contrary
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
terribly
ambitious
.
The
friend
had
little
or
no
friendship
,
but
he
was
the
favorite
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
himself
the
friend
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
king
's
brother
,
and
that
was
sufficient
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Ah
!
This
<UNK>
had
arrived
,
and
the
household
was
about
to
be
established
.
But
,
in
order
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
not
a
large
<UNK>
fortune
,
although
an
only
daughter
,
should
be
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
belong
to
some
great
princess
,
as
prodigal
as
the
dowager
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
covetous
.
It
is
plain
the
plan
was
formed
by
a
clear
head
;
it
is
plain
,
also
,
that
it
had
been
bravely
executed
.
Malicorne
was
a
vile
name
;
he
who
bore
it
had
too
much
wit
to
conceal
this
truth
from
himself
;
but
an
estate
might
be
purchased
;
and
Malicorne
of
some
place
,
or
even
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
itself
,
for
short
,
would
ring
more
nobly
on
the
ear
.
Love
apart
,
Malicorne
was
happy
;
but
this
love
,
which
he
could
not
help
feeling
,
he
had
the
strength
to
conceal
with
care
;
persuaded
that
at
the
lest
<UNK>
of
the
ties
by
which
he
had
bound
his
<UNK>
female
,
the
demon
would
overthrow
him
and
laugh
at
him
.
Malicorne
repeated
to
her
so
often
his
<UNK>
of
indifference
,
that
she
finished
sometimes
,
by
believing
him
;
and
then
she
believed
she
detested
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
By
her
means
Malicorne
learnt
all
that
passed
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
the
family
of
the
dowager
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
he
related
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
tales
that
made
him
ready
to
die
with
laughing
,
which
the
latter
,
out
of
idleness
,
took
<UNK>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
carried
them
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
left
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
we
have
said
,
and
went
to
find
his
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
in
temporary
retreat
in
the
city
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
had
then
no
expectation
of
anything
else
,
having
exhausted
all
his
resources
,
with
the
exception
of
selling
a
handsome
suit
of
cloth
and
satin
,
embroidered
and
laced
with
gold
,
which
had
been
the
admiration
of
the
court
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
reduced
to
this
extremity
of
neither
playing
nor
dancing
,
for
a
week
at
least
,
was
,
consequently
,
very
sad
;
he
was
expecting
a
<UNK>
,
and
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
enter
.
said
he
,
in
a
tone
which
nothing
can
describe
,
``

that

again

friend
?
''
``
Ay

but

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

put

stretched
himself

fixing

upon

,
``

he
;

took

<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
himself
with
a
sigh

and
leaning
on
his
left
elbow
,
in
his
best
hand
,
traced
the
following

up

devoured
the

with
his
eyes
;

this

Malicorne
held
it
at
a
distance
.

I
say

Malicorne
handed
him
the
first
document
,
and
narrowly
watched
the
count
's
face
,
who
,
as
he
read
it
began
to
laugh
.
Malicorne
bowed
.
``
The

Why

not
make

He
looked
at
the
holsters
with
the
air

connoisseur
and
said
,
without
hesitation
:
``
<UNK>
heavy

``

At
first
,
he
made
the
horse
walk
the
whole
circuit
of
the
court-yard
at
a
<UNK>
;
next
at
a
trot
;
lastly
at
a

In
looking
whether
the
bit
suited
his
mouth

I
saw
that
he
was
rising
<NUMBER>
,
the
very
age
when
the
<UNK>
of
a
horse
intended
for

charger
should
commence

The
drooping
of
the
<UNK>
would
almost
make
me
doubt
the
purity
of
its
German
breed
,

I
think
there
is
English
blood
in
him

That
is
not
a
provincial
cut
,
I
presume

But
let
us
resume
our
own
affair

<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
the
color
rise
in

At
the

about

appeared
on

<UNK>
he
saluted
Malicorne

great

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Bragelonne
approached
the
group
of
young
men
,
and
saluted
them
with
that
quiet
and
serious
manner
peculiar
to
him
.
``
This
is
admirable
-
delightful
.
The
young
men
saluted
each
other
in
a
restrained
manner
.
``
Upon
what
subject
?
''
``
At
least
,
inform
me
of
the
subject
under
discussion
.
''
``
What
was
your
opinion
,
monsieur
?

He
surrounds
himself
with

can
not
show

''
``
Do
you
know
who
has
just
been
nominated

musketeers

In
any
case
it
must
have
been
very
recently
,
for
the
appointment
was
vacant
<NUMBER>
days
ago
;
a
proof
of
which
is
,
that
the
king
refused

who
solicited
the
post
for
<NUMBER>
of
his

''
Can
you
tell
me
,
monsieur
,
who
does
not
know
him

''
The
discussion
was
becoming
full
of
bitterness
.
You
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
will
accompany
me
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
you
<PROPER_NOUN>

will
remain
here

and
as
all
that
is
done
here
is
under
your
advice
,
you
will
bestow
the
last
glance
upon
my
preparations
for
departure
.
''
While
pronouncing
these
latter
words
,
he
closely
observed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
order
to
perceive
what
effect
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
father
would
produce
upon
him
.
He
then
signed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
follow
him
who
had
been
engaged
in
balancing
himself
first
on
<NUMBER>
foot
,
then
on
the
other
.
Malicorne
learned
<NUMBER>
things
;
the
first
,
that
the
young
men
had
something
to
say
to
each
other
,
and
the
second
,
that
he
ought
not
to
walk
in
the
same
line
with
them
;
and
therefore
he
walked
behind
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by

what
then
?

''
``
What
cause
has
he
given
you
?
''
``
Ask
my

Moreover
there
are

not
be

away
by
blood
,
by
a
good
sword-thrust
loyally
given
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
shuddered
at
the
bitter
manner
in
which
the
young
man
smiled
.
``
At
all
events
,
''
he
observed
,
``
I
have
no
personal
ill-will
towards

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
I
do
not
know

''
In
the
meantime
they
had
reached
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
<UNK>
.
's
remark
was
,
``
Let
them
look
.
''
The
prince
turned
round
as
the
count
entered
,
and
perceiving
who
it
was
,
said
:
``
Ah
!
The
chevalier
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Well
,
and
I
shall
tell
it
you
.
''
And
he
held
out
to
him
a
<UNK>
of
the
finest
possible
execution
.
``
It
is
wonderful
,
''
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
My
opinion
is
that
the
portrait
must
be
flattering

''
``
My
opinion
,
my

is
that
you
are
too
handsome
for

''
It
seemed
as
if
the
chevalier
had
detected
some
mystery
in
these
words
,
which
were
incomprehensible
to
the
prince
,
for
he
exclaimed
:
``
Very
well
,
get
married
yourself
.
''
``
Besides
,
I
suppose
you
have
something
to
ask
from
me
before
leaving
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
And
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
hesitated
,
the
prince
said
:
``
If
it
be
money
,
nothing
could
be
more
fortunate

``
The

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
,
for
he
knew
very
well
that
nothing
displeased
the
prince
more
than
to
show
any

``

''
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
burst
out
laughing
.
``
Do
you
attach
much
importance
to
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
``
Ah
!
''
``
Really
,
count
,
you
treat
me
very
ill
to-day

''
replied
the
chevalier
.
``
Take
a

appointment
from
that

and
give
it
to
me

''
``
That

''
``
Yes

set
off
and
lose

``
Too

''
said
the
chevalier
;
``
endeavor
to
bring
them
both
back

''
As
soon
as
he
reached
the
vestibule
,
he
waved
in
the
air
the
paper
which
the
prince
had
signed
.
Wait
until
I
return
.
By
the
way
,
monsieur

is
it
true
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself
;
``
oh
!
This
brilliant

animated
company

the

were

<NUMBER>

It

indeed

<PROPER_NOUN>
himself

as
Malicorne
had
taken
possession

best
costume

he
had
not
been
able
to
get
any
other
than
a
suit

trimmed
with
silver
.
``
Well

my

he
exclaimed
,

are

in

''
``
Indeed

''
``
Where
are
you

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
laugh

``
What

mean

``
Yes

``

``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
attention
this
name
had
awakened
.
``
Well
,
what
I
have
told

Be

and
as
he
put
this
question
,
he
looked
slyly
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
though
to
interrogate
him
upon
the
degree
of
confidence
to
be
placed

``
Yes

yes

<PROPER_NOUN>
;

``
Tell

he
to

grasping

,
``
after

But

inquired
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
an
abstracted
air
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
do
not

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

<UNK>
at
the
remark

``
Gentlemen

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
an
undertone
.
and
breaking
through
the
horses
and
attendants
,
he
cleared
the
way
for
himself
towards
the
center
of
the
square
,
through
the
crowd
,
followed
by
the
whole
cavalcade
.
This
latter
proposition
appearing
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
rather
<UNK>
,
he
proposed
instead
that
they
should
first
rest
themselves
.
inquired
a
page
who
had
approached
the
group
.
Without
in
any
way
divining
the
count
's
project
,
his
friends
followed
him
,
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
people
whose
acclamations
and
delight
seemed
a
happy
omen
for
the
success
of
that
project
with
which
they
were
yet
unacquainted
.
Watch
was
impatiently
kept
from
the
different
<UNK>
.
The
rumor
now
spread
that
the
princess
was
arriving
.
But
when
it
was
observed
that
even
inside
the
harbor
the
boats
were
tossed
to
and
fro
,
and
that
beyond
the
jetty
the
waves
rose
mountains
high
,
dashing
upon
the
shore
with
a
terrible
<UNK>
,
it
will
readily
be
believed
that
not
<NUMBER>
of
those
frail
boats
would
be
able
with
safety
to
reach
a
fourth
part
of
the
distance
between
the
shore
and
the
vessels
at
anchor
.
``
Shall
we
get
into
that
boat
,
then
,
and
push
off
?
``
You
refuse
,
then
?
''
exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Is
that
your
last
word

<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
``
Then
I
go
alone

''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
he
:
``
we
want
<NUMBER>
places
in
your
boat
;
''
and
wrapping
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
pistoles
in
paper
,
he
threw
them
from
the
quay
into
the
boat
.
The
pilot
approached
the
side
of
the
boat
,
and
the
<NUMBER>
young
men
,
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
,
with
equal
<UNK>
,
jumped
into
the
boat
.
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
's
struggling
with
the
waves
,
it
reached
the
spot
where
the
admiral
's
vessel
was
anchored
,
and
from
the
side
of
which
<NUMBER>
boats
had
already
been
dispatched
towards
their
aid

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
handsome
young

,
from
<NUMBER>
to
<NUMBER>
years
of
age

advanced
to
meet
them
.
The
princess
,
at
this
reply
,
was
constrained
to
check
an
instinctive
tenderness
of
feeling
which
the
courage
displayed
by
the
count
had
awakened
.
In
a
few
words
he
explained
his
mission
,
explained
in
what
way
he
had
become
the
envoy
of
his
royal
highness
;
and
saluted
,
according
to
their
rank
and
the
reception
they
gave
him
,
the
admiral
and
several
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
noblemen
who
were
grouped
around
the
princesses
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
spoke
<PROPER_NOUN>
perfectly
,
and
constituted
himself
his
friend
's
interpreter
with
the
young
<PROPER_NOUN>
noblemen
,
who
were
indifferently
acquainted
with
the
French
language
.
``
Allow
me

observe

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
an
<UNK>
of
manner
which
he
did
not
seek
to
disguise
,
``

These

said
the
admiral
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
glanced
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
perceived
that
his
face
was
burning
with
confusion

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
haughtily
.
``
My

said
the
queen
,
``
permit

He
withdrew
,
almost
tottering
in
his
gait
,
and
nearly
stumbled
against
the
<UNK>
of
the
ship
.
The
admiral
seated
himself
at
the
right
hand
of
the
princess
,
and
placed
the

de
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
her
left

from

he
,
``

fixed
upon
his

extend

either

In
fact
,
from
the
moment
they
quitted

he
had
gradually
accustomed
himself
to
his
behavior

Do
you
not
perceive
how
that
insolent
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
killing
me
with
his

devotions
to
you

''
At
last
the
admiral
,
with
studied
delay
,
gave
the
last
orders
for
the
departure
of
the
boats
.
No
sooner
was
this
really
royal
boat
afloat
and
the
rowers
with
oars
<UNK>
,
awaiting
,
like
soldiers
presenting
arms

the
embarkation
of
the

,
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
forward
to
the
ladder
in
order
to
take
his
place

This
was
a
fresh
disappointment
for
the
duke
,
and
,
still
more
so
,
since
it
was
so
unexpected

His
directions
were
executed
with

The
young
duke
hesitated
,
looked
around
him
,
and
with
a
last
effort
,
<UNK>
by
contending
emotions
,
said
,
``

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
his
lips
,
as
if
he
were
about
to
speak
,
but
,
whether
thoughts
or
expressions
failed
him
,
not
a

escaped
them
,
and
turning
away
,
as
though
out
of
his

,
he
<UNK>
from
the
vessel
into
the
boat
.
While
the
boat
was
advancing
towards
the
shore
,
the
duke
kept
his
eyes
<UNK>
fixed
upon
the
admiral
's
ship
,
like

torn
away
from

about

Having

however

reached
the

which
had
been
set
apart
for

he
shut
himself
up
,
like

in
his
tent

The
cannon
from
the

fired
salutes

over

disappeared
in

to

``
Do

''
The
count
advanced
a
step
towards
his
friend
,
and
pressed
him
warmly
in
his

.
Upon
the
large
square
in

of
the
hotel
,
the
shadows
of
the
tents
,
<UNK>
by
the
golden
moonbeams

formed
as

were
a
huge
<UNK>
of
jet
and
yellow
<UNK>
.
Behind
them
he
could
perceive
the
shadow
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
eyes
glittering
in
the
obscurity
,
fastened
ardently
upon
the

sitting
apartment
,
which
was
partially
lighted
by
the
lamp
in
the
inner
room

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
not
the
only
<UNK>
.
Bragelonne
watched
for
some
time
the
conduct
of
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
,
listened
to
the
loud
and
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
snored
as
<UNK>
as
though
he
was
wearing
his
blue
and
gold
,
instead
of
his
violet
suit
.
During
the
last
few
hours
spent
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
every
preparation

the
departure
had
been
made

The
weather
was
very
fine

<UNK>
and
brilliant
<UNK>
received
them
everywhere
along

march

In
fact
,
it
was
not
difficult
to
perceive
that
his
most
devoted
attention
awakened
no
acknowledgment
,
and
that
the
grace
with
which
he
rode
<NUMBER>
of
his
most
fiery
horses
was
thrown
away
,
for
it
was
only
<UNK>
and
by
the
merest
accident
that
the
princess

eyes
were
turned
towards
him
.
Occasionally
he
obtained
a
word
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
a
recompense
,
and
yet
her
speech
seemed
almost
a
reproach
.
From
the

excited
conversation
the

held

<PROPER_NOUN>
made

Occasionally
during
the
journey
he
conversed
with
the
queen
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
respecting
the
power
of
fascination
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
possessed
,
and
the
mother
,
whom
so
many
misfortunes
and
<UNK>
had
taught
experience
,
replied
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

sure

be

''
At
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
princess
and
her
mother
had
changed
their
heavy
traveling
carriage
,
somewhat
<UNK>
by
the
journey
,
for
a
light

richly
decorated
chariot
drawn
by

horses
with
white

The
presentations
had
been
carelessly
made
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
the
rest
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
gentlemen
,
had
been
introduced
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
whom
they
had
received
but
very
indifferent
attention
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

knight

''
added
the
favorite
,
with
an
inflection
of
the
voice
which
envious
minds
can
alone
give
to
the
simplest

.
``
Has
she
a

,
then

``
Do

``
Thou
poison
the

The
honors

are
being
paid
to
your

you
are
not

``

She

``
Yes

her

``
But

Do

At

He
would
probably
have
retorted
,
but
at
this
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
quitted
the
carriage
to
join
the
prince
.
``
Thank
you
for
the
compliment

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
why
do
you
say
that

returned

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
stupefied

''
``
Yes
,
yes

''
said
the
prince
,
``
be
frank

''
In
order
to
avoid
betraying
his
real
thoughts
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
recourse
to
the
only
defense
which
a
man
taken
by
surprise
really
has
,
and
accordingly
told
an
untruth

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
colored
violently
.
The
chevalier
had
not
taken
his
eyes
off
him
.
I
had
forgotten
the
portrait
;
it
quite
escaped
my
recollection

''
inquired
the
duke
.
``
I
do
not

The
entree
was
brilliant
and
joyous
.
The
richest
hangings

the
thickest
carpets

glistening
<UNK>
and

with

in

could
be

<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
and
furniture

<UNK>
of

in

also

were
guards

with
floating

crowds

attendants

in

She
knew

too

this
brilliant
reception

paid
to
the
happy
mother

restored
to
his

a

second

in
<PROPER_NOUN>

while
the

reception
she
had
before
met
with
was
paid
to
her

the
daughter
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
a
punishment
for
having
been
unfortunate
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
next
sought
out
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
the
count
was
occupied
in
a
long
conference
with
his
<UNK>
and
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
consumed
his
whole
time

So
<PROPER_NOUN>
laughed
and
spent
his
money
.
Why
will
not
the

advance

a

But
what

there

``
I
am

While
all
this
was
going
on
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
resting
herself
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
engaged
in
writing

colored

colored

The
writing
was
that
of

inclosed
were
these

``
Take

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
approaching
his
friend

and
preparing
to
support
him
at
the
moment
the
archbishop
blessed
the
married
couple
.
It
was
remarked
that
the
king

who
had
seemed
more
than
surprised
at
his

most

de

,
as
this

resounded
through

a

seemed

rise
from

his

so
that
he
neither

the

finding

nothing

a

moved
forward

<UNK>
somewhat

The

already
<UNK>
herself

which

only

for

The
whole
scene
was
a
perfect
enigma
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
key
to
which

would
have
given
anything

To

the

But
the
very
<UNK>
which
he
saw
was
excited
against

made
him
take
a
serious

The

nothing

shortly

a

placed
both

led

The

summoned

showed

advanced
stealthily

The
marquise
entered
this
somewhat
extraordinary
vehicle
,
sitting
opposite
the
clerk
,
who
endeavored
to
put
his
knees
out
of
the
way
,
afraid
even
of
touching
the
marquise
's
dress
.
They
were
not
as
fleet
as
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
horses
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
consequently
took
<NUMBER>
hours
to
get
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
drew
a
key
from
her
pocket
,
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
,
pushed
open
the
door
,
which
noiselessly
yielded
to
her
touch
,
and
directed
the
clerk
to
carry
the
chest
upstairs
to
the
first
floor
.
She
closed
the
door
after
them
,
and
waited
in
the
room
,
alone
and
barricaded
.
The
marquise
lighted
the
candles
,
inhaled
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
,
sat
down
,
and
was
soon
plunged
in
profound
thought
.
Her
principal
thought
,
and
<NUMBER>
that
took
precedence
of
all
others
,
was
to
devise
means
of
leaving
this
money
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
his
possibly
learning
from
whom
the
gift
had
come
.
But
,
being
there
,
and
having
seen
the
boudoir
so
<UNK>
decorated
that
it
might
almost
be
said
the
least
<UNK>
of
dust
had
but
the
moment
before
been
removed
by
the
servants
;
having
observed
the
drawing-room
,
so
perfectly
arranged
that
it
might
almost
be
said
her
presence
there
had
driven
away
the
fairies
who
were
its
occupants
,
she
asked
herself
if
the
glance
or
gaze
of
those
whom
she
had
<UNK>
-
whether
spirits
,
fairies
,
<UNK>
,
or
human
creatures
-
had
not
already
recognized
her

No
!
Would
that
<UNK>
mind
,
that
inconstant
heart
,
be
likely
to
be
fixed
for
a

,
even
were
it

gaze

Who
can
tell
if
that
mind
,
when
the
<UNK>
is
applied
to
it
,
will
not
be
found
of
a

and
vulgar
character
?
With
a
feverish
impatience
she
rose
and
walked
towards
the
mirror
,
in
which
she
smiled
with
a
resolute
smile
of
devotedness
;
she
touched
the
spring
and
drew
out
the
handle
of
the
bell
.
He
looked
pale
,
and
seemed
bowed
down
by
the
weight
of
some
bitter
reflection
.
<UNK>
and
noble
he
still
was
,
and
the
melancholy
expression
of
his
mouth
,
a
rare
expression
with
men
,
gave
a
new
character
to
his
features
,
by
which
his
youth
seemed
to
be
renewed
.
They
can
conceal
their
own
feelings
from
a
man
,
but
from
them
no
man
can
conceal
his
.
She
arose
and
approached
him
,
saying
,
``

into

,
almost
a
Frenchman
from
wit

was
delighted

having
so

selected

Therefore

whenever

despite

he
was
lost

horses

remain

As

out

Both

seemed
like

those

were
looking
at

from
the

were
thrown
strongly

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
transferred
the
wounded
man
to
them
,
at
the
very
moment
the
latter
began
to
open
his
eyes
again
.
By
this
time
it
was
high
tide
;
embroidered
coats
and
silk
sashes
were
lost
;
many
hats
,
too
,
had
been
carried
away
by
the
waves
.
Any
<NUMBER>
who
happened
at
that
moment
to
contemplate
that
red
simar
-
the
<UNK>
robe
of
office
-
and
the
rich
lace
,
or
who
gazed
on
that
pale
brow
,
bent
in
anxious
meditation
,
might
,
in
the
solitude
of
that
apartment
,
combined
with
the
silence
of
the
ante-chambers
and
the
measured
paces
of
the
guards
upon
the
landing-place
,
have
fancied
that
the
shade
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
lingered
still
in
his
accustomed
<UNK>
.
In
truth
,
that
the
red
simar
which
occupied
the
wonted
place
was
his
no
longer
,
was
still
more
strikingly
<UNK>
from
the
isolation
which
seemed
,
as
we
have
observed
,
more
appropriate
to
a
phantom
than
a
living
creature
-
from
the
corridors
deserted
by
courtiers
,
and
courts
crowded
with
guards
-
from
that
spirit
of
bitter
ridicule
,
which
,
arising
from
the
streets
below
,
penetrated
through
the
very
<UNK>
of
the
room
,
which
resounded
with
the
murmurs
of
a
whole
city
leagued
against
the
minister
;
as
well
as
from
the
distant
and
incessant
sounds
of
guns
firing
-
let
off
,
happily
,
without
other
end
or
aim
,
except
to
show
to
the
guards
,
the
Swiss
troops
and
the
military
who
surrounded
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
the
people
were
possessed
of
arms
.
he
ejaculated
,
``
Italian
!
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
,
whilst
his
wonted
smile
,
full
of
subtlety
,
lent
a
strange
expression
to
his
pale
lips
;
``
yes
,
these
noises
prove
to
me
,
indeed
,
that
the
destiny
of

is
precarious
;
but
ye
shall
know
I
am
no
ordinary

And
at
this
word
the
smile
on
the
cardinal
's
lips
assumed
an
expression
of
hatred
,
of
which
his
mild
countenance
seemed
incapable
.
It
will
be
a
work
of
time
,
but

who
have
begun
by
crying
out
:

<PROPER_NOUN>

they
hated
during
his

<UNK>
and
impoverished
by
<UNK>
-
imposed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
avarice
impelled
him
to
<UNK>
them
down
to
the
very
dust
-
the
people
,
as
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
described
it
,
had
nothing
left
to
them
except
their
souls
;
and
as
those
could
not
be
sold
by
<UNK>
,
they
began
to
murmur
.
They
deputed
<NUMBER>
of
their
number
to
wait
upon
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
according

his
custom

affected

.
This
man

named
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
the
object
of
popular
<UNK>
,
in
the
first
place
because
he
was
superintendent
of
finance
,
and
every
superintendent
of
finance
deserved
to
be
hated
;
in
the
second
place
,
because
he
rather
deserved
the
<UNK>
which
he
had
incurred
.
exclaimed
the
monarch
.
``
Ah
;
so
much
the
better
!
''
This
was
the
same
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
became
eventually
superintendent
of
finance
.
The
fact
was
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
son
had
run
a
great
chance
of
being
suffocated
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
rioters
having
proposed
to
squeeze
him
until
he
gave
up
all
the
gold
he
had
swallowed
.
But
the
chief
president
had
replied
with
his
habitual
coolness
,
without
betraying
either
disturbance
or
surprise
,
that
should
the
agitators
refuse
obedience
to
the
king
's
wishes
he
would
have
gallows
erected
in
the
public
<UNK>
and
proceed
at
once
to
hang
the
most
active
among
them
.
These
poor
creatures
had
no
bad
intentions
.
He
took
the
opportunity
of
calling
out
his
guard
,
the
Swiss
troops
and
the
musketeers
,
and
he
had
planted
them
round
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
quays
,
and
on
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
first
,
indeed
,
they
were
doubtful
whether
the
king
's
visit
to
the
parliament
had
been
in
order
to
<UNK>
or
increase
their
<UNK>
;
but
scarcely
was
it
known
that
the
taxes
were
to
be
still
further
increased
,
when
cries
of
``
Down
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
For
the
people
had
learned
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
made
speeches
in
their
behalf
,
and
,
although
the
eloquence
of
these
deputies
had
been
without
avail
,
it
had
none
the
less
won
for
them
the
people
's
good-will
.
<UNK>
were
being
held
when
a
lieutenant
in
the
guards
,
named
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
made
his
appearance
,
with
his
clothes
all
torn
,
his
face
streaming
with
blood
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
arrested
<NUMBER>
of
the
<UNK>
and
had
ordered
him
to
be
hanged
near
the
cross
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
in
attempting
to
execute
this
command
the
<UNK>
were
attacked
in
the
market-place
with
stones
and
halberds
;
the
<UNK>
had
escaped
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
rushed
into
a
house
.
The
authorities
were
not
in
a
condition
to
<UNK>
with
serious
revolt
.
We
have
seen
in
what
state
of
mind
he
listened
to
the
murmurs
from
below
,
which
even
reached
him
in
his
seclusion
,
and
to
the
guns
,
the
firing
of
which
resounded
through
that
room
.
``
The
Black
Musketeers

lord

``
Lieutenant
d'Artagnan

''
The
valet
went
out
as
silently
as
he
had
entered
and
appeared
in
a
few
minutes
bringing
the
dress
demanded
.
When
he
was
left
alone
the
cardinal
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
with
a
feeling
of
<UNK>
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
the
valet-de-chambre
.
How
perfectly
he
remembered
his
former
entrance
into
that
very
room
!
``
I
am
that
individual
,
''
replied
the
officer
.
``
I
wish
to
visit
in

the

that
there
is
any
danger
in
so
doing
?
''
``
The
uniform
of
the
king
's
musketeers
carries
a
certain
respect
with
it
,
and
even
if
that
were
not
the
case
I
would
engage
with
<NUMBER>
of
my
men
to
put
to
flight
a
<NUMBER>

.
''
``
Every
<NUMBER>

his

''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
cardinal
put
it
on
in
military
style
.
``
Well
,
let
us
set
out
.
''
This
way
-

<UNK>
groups
paraded
the
streets
and
,
whatever
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
think
of
it
,
it
was
<UNK>
that
the
citizens
had
for
the
night
laid
aside
their
usual
forbearance
,
in
order
to
assume
a
warlike
aspect
.
When
he
approached
a
group
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
urged
his
horse
upon
it
without
a
word
of
warning
;
and
the
members
of
the
group
,
whether
rebels
or
not
,
as
if
they
knew
with
what
sort
of
a
man
they
had
to
deal
,
at
once
gave
place
to
the
patrol
.
After
which
he
inquired
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
were
not
the
commanding
officer
at
the
<UNK>
.
He
instantly
retired
,
from
a
feeling
of
respectful
delicacy
;
it
was
,
however
,
evident
that
the
cardinal
was
recognized
by
both
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
the
other
officers
on
horseback
.
Are
you
aware
that
the

have
even
suggested

``
And

``
It
seems
that
some

remarked
at

reminded
him

who

irritated

wished

nothing

at

pointed

situated
on

exclaimed

bit

He
led
the

toward

He

themselves

From

felt
lonely

without

His

the

conceived

assigned

He

The

roared

felt

invaded

``

he
reflected

I

In

so
he
went

His

on
entering

was
to
lock
up

his

and
then
as
soon
as
supper

he
sent

As

was

resumed
<PROPER_NOUN>

when

he

related
to

The

would
willingly
have
prolonged
this
conversation
far
into
the
night
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
pointed
out
to
him
that
his
guest
must
need
repose

He
admitted
without
annoyance
the
continued
superiority

over
himself
,
devoid
as
he
was
of
that
jealousy
which
might

he
was
delighted
also
that
the

The
absence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose

never

been
uttered
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
gave
D'Artagnan
uneasiness

At

low

into

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
went
to

apparently

noise
ceased

Somebody

moving
stealthily

The

The

his

brushed

from

the
brim

went
downstairs

confused

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
for
a

moments
thoughtful

On
his
side
D'Artagnan
became
more
cautious
also
.
But
such

man

we
always
want
something
more
than

already

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
laughing
.
''
Ah

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
a
look
of
vexation
on
the
face
of
the
youth
.
``

what

cried
the
young
man
,
turning
pale
.
As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
scarcely
,
on
his
side
,
was
he
out
of
sight
when
he
drew
from
his

a

he
read
over
again
:

an

wishing

about

he
remained
in

He

with

The

made
the

by

it

drew

looked

at

When

laughed

then
proposed

remarked

going

himself

looking
over

working

entered

smiled

reflected

remembered

that

<NUMBER>
minutes
afterward
the
officer
entered
and
the

seemed
to
be
<UNK>
in
the
sublime
combinations
of
chess

They
had
told
him
to
hope

had
not

Still

with

approached

seemed

reappear

bringing

all

remembrances

more

In

all

the

in

pictured
in

another

<PROPER_NOUN>
:

the

been
part

therefore
everything
which

de

related
was
new
to
his

The

which
were
more

used

stopped
at

at
<NUMBER>

The

extended
from

the

loaded

they
awoke

They
obtained
information

he

with

approached

He
raised
himself
to
glance
in
the
direction

they
pointed
out

saw
the

and
fell
back
upon
the

his

illumined
by
joy

The
host
and
his

were
standing
on
the
steps
,
whilst
the
unhappy
man
seemed
to
suffer
dreadful
pain
and
yet
to
be

``
No

the

Just
as
the

his

disappeared
in
their

,
a

stopped
on
the
threshold

<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
up

asked
the

``
We

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
If
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
slow
in
speaking

we
know
that
he
was
quick
to
act

he
sprang
to
the

shook
it
violently
,

it
was
bolted
on

There

he
.
The
blade
of
a
dagger
was
buried
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
left
side
of
the
executioner
.
The
host
quitted
the
room
in
agitation
,
and
as
for
his
wife
,
she
had
fled
at
the
sound
of
her
husband
's
cries
.
And
besides
,
he
considered
it
most
expedient
,
without
exhibiting
too
much
ill-will
,
to
follow
to
the
end
his
role
as
confessor
.
``
Men

replied
the
monk
,
dryly
.
``
Yes

in

much
more

``
You

cried
the

the

of
a

declared
after

exclaimed
the
executioner
,
``
you

'
The
monk
doubtless
feared
that
he
would
die
without
saying
more
,
for
he
exclaimed
eagerly
:
``
Go

I
know

The
executioner
opened
his
eyes
,
turned
toward
the
young
man
and
grasped
his
arm
.

It
was
evening
;
I
had
thrown
the

into
the
river

those

my

<UNK>
to
me

pronounced

with

As

The

followed

no

ventured

It
fell
naturally
to
the

to
make

;
not

was

the

Now

it
was
these
to

The

read

hastened
on

Meanwhile
,
as
the

drew
nearer
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
noise

sounded
louder

At

they
heard

so

At

they
looked
down

and
before

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
,
took
the
letter
,
went
hastily
down
the
mountain
,
leaped
on
his
horse
and
set
out
at

All
the

was
ready
to
move
,
and
started
off
at

notice

The

was
announced
by

Still
a

lighted
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was

assigned

kept

the

sought
the

together

was
accorded
them

On

<NUMBER>

those

become

those

become

The

sometimes
looked
up
at
each

and
smiled
;
they
understood
without
speaking

so
delicate

sympathetic

They
then
embraced
each

and
each
wrapping

in

they
soon
passed
into

The

never

more

that

Now
the

began

scarcely
waiting

had
finished
before

took
the
letter
and
read
it
thus

The
young

drew
from
his
pocket
a
second
letter
,
presented
it
to
the
cardinal

and
took
his
seat
.

<PROPER_NOUN>
now
understood

desired
to
retain

Then
he
added
aloud
,
``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

hoping
by
a
display
of
affected

to
catch
the

in
a
snare

at
the
young

,

at
the
fire
which
shot
from
his
glance
he
bent
his
head
;
then
,
embarrassed
how
to
continue
such
a

he
opened
<PROPER_NOUN>

letter

Let
us
see
what
this

contains

Placed
by
popular
confidence
at
the
head
of
that
movement
,
I
can
appreciate
better
than
any
other
its
significance
and
its
probable
results

maintained

civil

in

The

continued
in
thought
.
You
need

that
interior
condition

repose

attain

My

the

And
he
threw
an
uneasy

at
his
strong
box

he
even
turned
inside
the
<UNK>
of
the
magnificent
diamond

the

moved

``
Well

The

bit
her

and
moved
impatiently
on
her
chair
.
``
With

Though
all
bowed
before
her

as
etiquette
required

she
had
now
but
a
single
arm
on

could
lean

entered

He
reflected
for
a
second

then
descended
the
stairs

At
this
sight
the
young

stopped
short
,
not
in
admiration
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
as

fascinated
at
the
sight
of
some
terrible
object

He
had
not
long
to
wait

for

remained
a

an

this

a

him

<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
the
carriage
,
and
when
he
had
watched
it
drive
beneath
the
sombre
arches
he
went
and
stationed
himself
under
a
wall
over
which
the
shadow
was
extended

remained
motionless

amidst
the
moldings

<PROPER_NOUN>

does
the
cardinal
refuse
to
receive
the
king
?
``
But
did
you
see
the
queen

''
He
was
embarrassed
whilst
speaking
to
me
and
yet
quite
firm
in
his
determination
to
refuse
.
I
made
such
haste
that
I
am
certain
of
not
having
been
forestalled
.
I
shall
go
and
die
by
his

''
exclaimed
the
poor
queen
,
raising
her
eyes
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
have
You

Have

Has

in

But
that
act
of
self-control
,
effective
as
it
was
,
did
not
escape
the
eyes
of
the
young
princess
.
Then
turning
toward
her

:

At

on

upon

stood
out
with

The

the

as

gone
there
for

he
took
his

at

beating

<UNK>
quite

pale
with
anger

her

At

a

was
heard

At
this

the

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
became
alarmed
in

;
but
the
cries

replied
to

poor

he
had

uttered
it
to
make

cried

she
went
out

The

unconsciously
touched
here
upon

the

the

When

touching

on

chest
with

said

So
D'Artagnan
began
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
he
said
,
with
desperate
politeness
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that

whom
the

brought
over
from

whom
he
doubtless
took

''
sir

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
how

you

The

became
you
very
well

and
as

the
axe
,
I
do
not
think
it
would
be
out

even
at

What

no

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as

reply
at

to
the

arrange
the

better

they

do
so

the
best

I
can
furnish
is
this

So
saying
,
he
threw
his
hat
on
the
ground
,
pushed
back
his
chair
to
the
wall
and
bowed
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
true
French
grace

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
move

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
you
sufficiently
not
to
refuse

have

I

will
begin

I
hate
you
all
,
but
not
equally
.
``
It
is

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
hoping
he
would
choose
<NUMBER>
of

<UNK>
this
honour
to
somebody

``

''
``
At

that
will
conciliate
us

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
stood
with
his
arms
folded
,
apparently
as
calm
as
any
man
could
be
in
such
circumstances
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
put
his
hand
into
the
hat
,
took
out
<NUMBER>
of
the
<NUMBER>
papers
and
disdainfully
dropped
it
on
the
table
without
reading

.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
turning
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
:
``
I
hope
,
sir

said
he
,
``
you
have
no

``
Are

``
Nor

``
On

<PROPER_NOUN>

This

made
no

<PROPER_NOUN>

``
Aha

``
Ah

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

However
,
as
they
were
fighting
in

had
not
space
to
go
on
like
that
forever
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's

at

touched

No

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
having
got
up

stepped
back

prepare

the

he

attacking

the

seemed

<PROPER_NOUN>
disappeared
through

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
blade
,
caught
between

shivered
like

of

.
``

his

instead

<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
to
sustain

on

the

down

nothing

The

constant

clasped

stretched
