laughs

that

record

This
disclosure
was
,
indeed
,
well
calculated
to
call
forth
a
furious
outbreak
among

The

acquitted

Being

run
rather

which
was
the
reason
why
the

hurrying

The

even
began
to
vent
its

not

the

being

there

And
indeed
the
sallow
physiognomy

the
thin

the

ways

the

The
<UNK>
of
the
morning
chilled
his
frame
,
but
he
did
not
feel
the
cold
,
the
hope
of
revenge
keeping

He
ran
up
to

with

what

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
could

the

of

<UNK>
,
which
,
fortunately
,
was

less
consequence
than

Just
then
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
offered
a
prize
for
the
discovery
-LRB-
we
dare
not
say
the
manufacture
-RRB-
of
a
large
black
tulip
without
a
spot
of
colour
,
a
thing
which
had
not

been
accomplished
,
and
was
considered
impossible
,
as
at
that
time
there
did
not
exist
a
flower
of
that
species
approaching
even
to
a
dark
nut
brown
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
tulip-growers
who
were
struck
with
the
idea
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
of
it
in
the
light
of
a
speculation
.
But
this
is
not
a
<UNK>
upon

in

;
it
is
the

of
<NUMBER>
particular
tulip
which

write
,
and
to
that
we
limit
ourselves
,
however
<UNK>
the
subject
which
is
so
closely
allied
to
ours
.
He
breathed
through
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
tulips
,
<UNK>
his
thirst
with
the
water
he
sprinkled
upon

,
and
<UNK>
on
the
fine
soft
earth
which
his
neighbour
scattered
upon
his
cherished
bulbs
.
He
knew
what
<PROPER_NOUN>
meant
when
<UNK>
certain
<UNK>
,
then
<UNK>
them
,
then
<UNK>
them
with

by
a

of
<UNK>
,
-
a

and
<UNK>
delicate
<UNK>
,
-
and
when
he
shut
up
in
darkness
those
which
were
expected
to
furnish
the
black
colour
,
exposed
to
the
sun
or
to
the
lamp
those
which
were
to

and
placed
between

reflections

<UNK>
those
intended
for

,
the

of

.
But
it

that

should
<UNK>
with
this
epoch
of
the
operations
of
the
<NUMBER>
,
and
the
<UNK>
of
the
other
,
the
visit
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
to
pay
to
his
native
town
.
All
this
hubbub
excited
the
attention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
just
taking
his
meal
by
his
<UNK>
.
They
need
the
shelter
of
the
house
,
the
soft
bed
on
the
shelves
,
and
the
congenial
warmth
of
the
stove
.
The
younger
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
bowing
assent
,
said
aloud
,
-
``
Would
you
now
,
sir
,
please
to
see
my
dry-room
?
''
At
the
mere
mention
of
the
dry-room
,
therefore
,
the
servants
who
were
carrying
the
lights
respectfully
fell
back
.
Then
<NUMBER>
dark
figures
appeared
.
His
first
thought
was
that
this
precious
deposit
enclosed
some
newly
<UNK>
bulbs
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
he
soon
reflected
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
very
little
<UNK>
to
tulip-growing
,
and
that
he
only
occupied
himself
with
the
affairs
of
man
,
a
pursuit
by
far
less
peaceful
and
agreeable
than
that
of
the
florist
.
And
,
besides
,
if
the
parcel
had
been
made
up
of
bulbs
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
his
neighbour
too
well
not
to
expect
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
not
have
lost
<NUMBER>
moment
in
<UNK>
his
curiosity
and
feasting
his
eyes
on
the
present
which
he
had
received
.
The
deposit
intrusted
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
carefully
locked
up
by
him
,
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
correspondence
with
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
war
minister
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
only
the
godfather
<UNK>
giving
to
his
godson
the
least
intimation
concerning
the
political
importance
of
the
secret
,
merely
desiring
him
not
to
deliver
the
parcel
to
any
<NUMBER>
but
to
himself
,
or
to
<UNK>
he
should
send
to
claim
it
in
his
name
.
On
the
20th
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
,
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
therefore
in
his
dry-room
,
with
his
feet
resting
on
the
<UNK>
of
the
table
,
and
his
elbows
on
the
cover
,
looking
with
intense
delight
on
<NUMBER>
suckers
which
he
had
just
detached
from
the
mother
bulb
,
pure
,
perfect
,
and
entire
,
and
from
which
was
to
grow
that
wonderful
produce
of
horticulture
which
would
render
the
name

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for

illustrious

I
need
no
more
be
afraid
lest
on
the
day
of
a
riot
the
shopkeepers
of
the
town
and
the
sailors
of
the

should
come
and
tear
out
my

But

Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
indulged
in

contemplation
,
and
was
carried
away
by

he
asked

``

``

said
a

in

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
eagerly
picking
up
his

,
``
what

''
``
All

That

he
said
;

,
looking
at

with
almost

affection

he
exclaimed
,
``

as
the

and
fell
back
a

<UNK>
about
for
a
paper
in
which
to
wrap

up
,
he
noticed
the
fly-leaf
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
laid
upon

took
it
without

remembering
whence

folded
in

the

secreted

in

waited

``

answered
<PROPER_NOUN>

politely
,
to

``

He
had
,
indeed
,
heard
nothing
,
but
he
had
seen
everything
,
and
had
rightly
concluded
that
the
papers
intrusted
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
Doctor
must
have
been
of
great
importance
,
as
he
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
so
carefully
<UNK>
the
parcel
in
the
drawer
where
he
used
to
keep
his
most
precious
bulbs
.
Besides
this
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
encouraged
himself
with
the
following
<UNK>
:
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
a
bad
citizen
,
as
he
is
charged
with
high

and
arrested
.
<UNK>
as
this
mode
of
reasoning
might
sound
,
it
would
not
perhaps
have
taken
so
complete
a
hold
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
nor
would
he
perhaps
have
yielded
to
the
mere
desire
of
vengeance
which
was
gnawing
at
his
heart
,
had
not
the
demon
of
envy
been
joined
with
that
of
cupidity
.
If
<PROPER_NOUN>
should
be
arrested
there
would
necessarily
be
a
great
upset
in
his
house
,
and
during
the
night
after
his
arrest
no
one
would
think
of
keeping
watch
over
the
tulips
in
his
garden
.
Accordingly
,
he
wrote
an
anonymous
information
,
the
minute
<UNK>
of
which
made
up
for
its
want

authenticity

posted
his

,
whether
from

weakness

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
venture
that

to
point

either
at

laboratory

or
at

dry-room
.
About
<NUMBER>
o'clock
he
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
street
which
made
him
tremble
,
at
this
moment
he
was
paler
than
a
real
invalid
,
and
shook
more
violently
than
a

in
the
height

``

said
the

``
Oh

muttered
,
or
rather
growled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
closing
his
eyes
from
the
dreadful
picture
which
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
closed
in
.
He
had
calculated
correctly
;
no
one
thought
of
keeping
watch
over
the
garden
;
the
house
and
the
servants
were
all
in
the
utmost
confusion
.
This
silence
and
this
darkness
emboldened
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
got
<UNK>
the
wall
,
stopped
for
an
instant
,
and
,
after
having
ascertained
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
he
put
his
ladder
from
his
own
garden
into
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
descended
.
He
felt
about
close
by
it
,
-
nothing
.
In
fact
,
whilst
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
lying
in
bed
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
gone
down
to
his
garden
,
had
taken
up
the
mother
bulb
,
and
,
as
we
have
seen
,
divided
it
into
<NUMBER>

<PROPER_NOUN>
with
rage
,
he
returned
to
his
ladder
,
mounted
the
wall
,
drew
up
the
ladder
,
flung
it
into
his
own
garden
,
and
jumped
after
it
.
Everything
,
therefore
,
depended
upon
whether
he
could
procure
a
ladder
of
sufficient
length
,
-
<NUMBER>
of
<NUMBER>
feet
instead
of
<NUMBER>

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
it
,
carried
it
with
great
exertion
to
his
garden
,
and
with
even
greater
difficulty
raised
it
against
the
wall
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
house
,
where
it
just
reached
to
the
window
.
However
,
he
took
courage
again
:
he
had
not
gone
so
far
to
turn
back
with
empty
hands
.
howled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
over
everything
in
the
dry-room
,
``
where

them

''
Would
any

leave
them
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
<NUMBER>
goes
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
sank
quite
paralyzed
on
that
very
table
,
and
on
that
very
spot
where
,
some
hours
before
,
the
unfortunate
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
so
leisurely
,
and
with
such
intense
delight
,
contemplated
his
darling
bulbs
.
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
treasures
about
him
,
so
entirely
were
his
thoughts
absorbed
by
another
<UNK>
treasure
,
let
himself
out
by
the
window
,
glided
down
the
ladder
,
carried
it
back
to
the
place
whence
he
had
taken
it
,
and
,
like
a
beast
of
prey
,
returned
growling
to
his
house
.
But
this
fury
had
vented
itself
most
fully
on
the
<NUMBER>
brothers
when
they
were
overtaken
by
the
murderers
,
thanks
to
the
precaution
which
<PROPER_NOUN>

the
man

had
taken
in
having
the
gates

the
city
closed

<PROPER_NOUN>
came
forth
trembling
behind
the
courageous
<PROPER_NOUN>

The

were
only
dragging
in
the
<NUMBER>
corpses

which
they
came
back
to
gibbet
at
the
usual
place
of
execution
.
Well

we
have
the

''
The
young
girl
,
whilst
the
prisoner
was
mounting
the
staircase
,
appeared
at
the
narrow
door
of
her
chamber
,
which
opened
on
that
very
flight
of
steps
;
and
,
holding
the
lamp
in
her
right
hand
,
she
at
the

time
lit
up
her
pretty
<UNK>
face
,
surrounded
by
a
profusion
of
rich
<UNK>
golden
locks
,
whilst
with
her
left
she
held
her
white

closely
over
her
breast
,
having
been
roused
from
her
first
slumber
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
vision
lasted
but
a
moment
,
-
much
less
time
than
we
have
taken
to
describe
it
.
Thus
left
alone
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
threw
himself
on
his
bed
,
but
he
slept
not
,
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
narrow
window
,
barred
with
iron
,
which
looked
on
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
in
this
way
saw
from
behind
the
trees
that
first
pale
beam
of
light
which
morning
<UNK>
on
the
earth
as
a
white
mantle
.
On
it
were
suspended
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
trunks
,
which

were
no

bleeding

``

he
cried

``

And
,
trembling

pale
,
and
gasping
for
breath
,
he
pointed
to
the
gibbet
at
the

side
of
the
yard

with
the

he

there
was
not

not
a

On
the

evening
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
brought
the
prisoner
his

,
slipped
on
the
damp
flags
whilst
opening
the

and
fell
,
in
the
attempt

steady

on

;
but
as
it
was
turned
the
wrong
way

he
broke
his

just
above

During
all
this
time
the
door
of
the
cell
stood
open
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
himself
almost
free

<PROPER_NOUN>
understood
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
,
at
the
very
moment
when
the
suspicion
arose
in
her
heart
.
Oh
,
sir
!
Gryphus
recovered
from
his
swoon
,
opened
his
eyes
,
and
as
his
brutality
was
returning
with
his

,
he
growled

<PROPER_NOUN>
lent
the
sufferer
her
shoulder
;
he
put
his

arm
around
her
neck
,
and
making
an
effort
,
got
on
his

,
whilst
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to

a

pushed
a

towards
him

had
made
use
of

take
off

up
his

But
,
instead

up
to

prescription

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
having
satisfied
herself
that
her

was
still
unconscious

approached

received

felt
as

shining
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not

the

on

to
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
no

any

had
been
delivered
to

by
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
,
but
he
also
stated
all
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
done
.
He
explained
that
,
since
the
day
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
handed
to
him
the
parcel
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
himself
had
never

He
replied
that
his

loved
him
too
well
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
he
was
too
<UNK>
a

anything

contents
of

,
well
knowing
that
such

would
only
have
caused
anxiety

As

as
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
concerned
,
it
was
impossible
to
find
him
,
as
he
had
left

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
accept
of
this
hypocritical
protection
,
and
in
a

answer
,
which
he
set
forth
with
the
noble
bearing
of

the
calm
serenity
of
a

he
said
,
-
``
You

This
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
whole
defence
;
after
which
the
judges
began
to
deliberate
on
the
<UNK>
.
The
judge
summed
up
with
the
following
dilemma
:
-
``
Either
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

in
either

,
he

first

his

secondly
,
because

by

leave
no

This
argument
<UNK>
all

,
in
order

much
the
more
effectually
to
destroy
the

<UNK>
pronounced

Master
Gryphus
was
detained
in

by
the
fever
caused
by
the
<UNK>
of
his
arm
.
After
the
sentence
was
read
,
the
Recorder
asked
him
whether
he
had
anything
to
answer
.
But
whilst
he
was
about
to
withdraw
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
,
``

he

to
lock

away

Then

casting

he
perceived

But
at
this

his

closed
involuntarily

to

the

was
about

fall

his

he

There

And
then

His

look
was
towards

Among
all
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

undoubtedly
the

a

was
separated
from

only
by
the

surrounded

The

answered
by

which
was
meant

-
``

it

all

Thus
to
the

proposals
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
made

the

the

jailer
had
only
answered

<PROPER_NOUN>
out

On

the

But
for

The
headsman
,
on
the

had
scarcely
anything

to
earn
his

The

also
readily

that

How

he

Every

irritated
him

And
so
,
then

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
live

flower
for

He
wanted
to
run
after
the
coach
which
was
carrying
away
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
with
his
bulbs

But
on
arriving
at
the
prison
he
met
with
an
honour
even
greater
.
The
cell
had
an
historical
character

A
flower
,
and
a
woman
;
both
of

as
he
conceived

lost

These

said
to

are
coming

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

from

the

made
a

for

such

a
day
;
and
,
after
a

he
at

caught
a

.
Thus
it
went
on
for
<NUMBER>
days

at
first
to
the

then
to

The

not
live

He
put

He
had
scarcely
withdrawn

went
to
the
door
to
listen
to
the

as

he
ran
to

still
vibrating
through

when

heard
on

the
light

the

of
the
flowing

the
fair
Frisian
maid
,
and
soon
after
a

appeared
at
the

in

fixed
his

Saying

put
his

near

withdrew

Only
she

resolved
within

``

he

tell

traced
out
for

my

And
as
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
approached
the

However
that

from

life

again
full

He
half
filled

mixed
the
earth

the
garden
with
a

dried

a

formed

They

began

about

There
was
in
that
false
bulb
some
<UNK>
,
perhaps
some
means
of
correspondence
with
conspirators
against
his
Highness

has
granted
you
your

``
Yes

yes

<PROPER_NOUN>

quite
beyond

with

the

of
that

so
many
joys

so
many

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
are
always
very
troublesome
fellows

these

''
And
certainly
the
unfortunate
prisoner
would
have
fallen
ill
but
for
the
<UNK>
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
granted
to
his
grief
,
and
which
was
called
<PROPER_NOUN>

the
prisoner
asked
,
with
a
doleful
look
.
``
Ah
yes

``
If

The

crushed
the

``
I

`
Well

I
quite

``
But
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
that

not

I

first

said
my

I

my

turned
my

advanced
towards
the

''
``
The

struck
me

take
him
down

``
I
am
afraid

``
So
he

``
Not

You

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

with

``

She
pronounced
these
words
with
a
smile
,
which
was
not
altogether
without
a
tinge
of
irony
.
If
I
thus
give
up
the
only

last
resource
which
we
possess
to
the
uncertain
chances

the
bad

I

``
And
even
,
''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
more
and
more
with
his
subject
,
``
if
you
should
perceive

<PROPER_NOUN>

''
``
What
is
it
?
''
``
I

''
said
she
,
bursting
out
in
sobs
,
``
I
see
that
you
love
your

such

have
no

''
Perhaps
she
would
never
return
to
see
the
prisoner
,
and
then
he
would
have
no
more
news
,
either
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
of
his
tulips
.
But
as
there
was
no
one
to
tell
her
so
,
and
as
the
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
thoughtless
speech
had
fallen
upon
her
heart
like
drops
of
poison
,
she
did
not
dream
,
but
she
wept
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
understood
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
preference
of
the
tulip
to
herself
,
but
was
only
so
much
the
more
unhappy
<UNK>
.
``
Alas
!
''
she
was
mistaken
.
As
,
however
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
already
able
to
write
a
<UNK>
hand
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
so
<UNK>
opened
his
heart
,
she
did
not
despair
of
<UNK>
quickly
enough
to
write
,
after
<NUMBER>
days
at
the
latest
,
to
the
prisoner
an
account
of
his
tulip
.
Yet
during
the
whole
of
that
day
he
was
haunted
with
a
vague
uneasiness
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
was
the
fear
lest
<PROPER_NOUN>
should
not
come
in
the
evening
to
pay
him
her
usual
visit
.
In
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
cell
<NUMBER>
heard
the
<UNK>
of
the
clock
of
the
fortress
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
to
repress
as
it
were
its
violent
<UNK>
,
and
listened
.
The
hour
had
struck
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
come
.
She
will
come
no
more
,
and
she
is
right
in
staying
away
;
in
her
place
I
should
do
just
the
same
.
''
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
even
look
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Except
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
never
came
during
the
day
.
At
the
third
visit
of
the
day
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
changed
his
former
inquiry
:
-
``
I
hope
nobody
is
ill
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
But
another
time
the
hours
passed
away
without
bringing
the
sweet
vision
which
lighted
up
,
through
the
grated
window
,
the
cell
of
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
which
,
in
retiring
,
left
light
enough
in
his
heart
to
last
until
it
came
back
again
.
The
evening
closing
in
,
his
despair
changed
into
melancholy
,
which
was
the
more
gloomy
as
,
involuntarily
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
mixed
up
with
it
the
thought
of
his
poor
tulip
.
The
weather
was
<UNK>
;
the
air
,
though
still
damp
,
began
to
be
tempered
by
those
pale
rays
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
sun
which
,
being
the
first
,
appear
so
congenial
,
although
so
pale
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
dumb
with
grief
,
and
pale
from
utter
prostration
,
stretch
out
his
head
through
the
iron
bars
of
his
window
,
at
the
risk
of
not
being
able
to
draw
it
back
again
,
to
try
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
garden
on
the
left
spoken
of
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
told
him
that
its
<UNK>
overlooked
the
river
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
remained
in
bed
the
whole
day
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
grew
pale
as
death
.
On
the
following
morning
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
got
up
to
drag
himself
to
the
window
,
he
perceived
a
paper
which
had
been
slipped
under
the
door
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
being
at
liberty
,
found
in
her
own
will
the
force
not
to
come
and
see
him
,
who
was
dying
with
grief
at
not
having
seen
her
.
After
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
made
his
last
visit
of
the
day
,
and
darkness
had
set
in
,
he
slipped
the
paper
under
the
door
,
and
listened
with
the
most
intense
attention
,
but
he
neither
heard
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
footsteps
nor
the
rustling
of
her
gown
.
On
the
following
evening
,
at
the
usual
hour
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
some
<NUMBER>
scratch
at
the
grated
little
window
,
just
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
in
the
<UNK>
of
their
friendship
.
``
I
saw
that
you
did
not
eat
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
my
father
told
me
that
you
remained
in
bed
all
day
.
``
It
is
true
;
I
have
received
it
.
''
Accordingly
I
am
come
to
see
whether
there
might
not
be
some
remedy
to
restore
you
to
health
.
''
Whether
she
did
not
,
or
would
not
,
understand
this
look
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
answered
gravely
,
-
``
I
have
only
to
speak
to
you
about
your
tulip

which
,
as
I
well
know
,

<UNK>
in
your
mind

''
muttered
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
again
!
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
with
a
melancholy
air
.
``
<UNK>
!
''
``
And
what
did
he
come
for
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
growing
even
paler
at
this
piece
of
information
than
he
had
been
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
fortnight
before
,
had
told
him
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
coming
for
her
sake
.
To
you
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
given
the
thought
and
strength
for
defending
yourself
;
but
to
my
poor
tulip
,
when
it
is
in
danger
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
given
nothing
of
the
sort
.
''
he
cried
.
``
On
the
following
day
,
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
,
``
remembering
what
you
had
told
me
about
the
stratagem

I
was
to
employ
to
ascertain
whether

after
the
tulip
,

``
Yes

yes

I
thank
you
a
<NUMBER>
times
for

``
And
then
the
same
shadow
glided
between
the
gate
and
the
wall
,
and
once
more
disappeared
behind
the
<UNK>
.
''
``
And
he
,

what
did
he
do
during
all
this
time
?
''
``
Then
,
after
having
finished
my

work

I
retired

``
Oh

But
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
;
what
have
you
done
with

``
Where

it
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
somewhat
relieved
.
``
You
may
make
yourself
comfortable
on
that
score

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
;
``
your

is
not
growing

I
have
heard
you

often

fitted

``

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
shook
her
head

after
which
followed
a
pause

``

exclaimed
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
,
and
without
caring
any

to
hide
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
this
dew

dropping
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
.
``
Indeed

``
As
to
that

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

``
Granted

And
,
saying
this
,
she
brought
her
fresh
cheek
,
as
if
unconsciously
,
so
near
the
iron
grating
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
able
to
touch
it
with
his
lips
.
Its
walls
were
black
,
its
air
<UNK>
,
the
iron
bars
seemed
to
exclude
every
ray
of
light
.
``
Halloa

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
him
with
a
<UNK>
.
``
Thank

said
the

;
``

``
And

''
``

''
``
At
noon
?
''
It
struck
<NUMBER>
,
and
there
were
heard
on
the
staircase
not
only
the
steps
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
also
those
of
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
soldiers
,
who
were
coming
up
with
him
.
They
searched
not
only
the
pockets
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
even
his
person
;
yet
they
found
nothing
.
And
certainly
never
did
prisoner
look
with
greater
complacency
at
a
search
made
in
his
cell
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
<UNK>
that
day
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
at
<NUMBER>
.
And
lastly

the
light
would
have
shown
her
blushes

At
last
,
when
the
clock
struck
<NUMBER>
,
they
parted
as
usual

This
was
indeed
a
great
defect
in
<PROPER_NOUN>

But
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
his
dreams
was
by
far
more
perfect
than
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
real
life
.
Ah
!
There
was
<NUMBER>
consolation
:
of
the
<NUMBER>
hours
during
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
not
allow
the

to
be
mentioned

<NUMBER>
had
passed
already

the

would
pass
quickly
enough
:
<NUMBER>
with
waiting
for
the
evening

interview

and
<NUMBER>
with
rejoicing
in
its
remembrance

she
had
no
idea
that
these

little

were
much

Who
?
Well

my

the

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Ah

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
understood
that
he

``
How

?
''
said
she
.
``
Oh

you

From

marked
some

<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
near
,
not
by

intentionally

<PROPER_NOUN>
kissed
her
tenderly
.
I

well
it
is

to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
with
money
you
will
find
a

she
said
.
``

It

true
that
he
did
so

no

would

``
And
that

?
''
The
prisoner
's
prayer
ended
in
a
sigh
of
ecstasy
;
his
lips
met
those
of
the
maiden
,
-
not
by
chance
,
nor
by
stratagem
,
but
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
was
to
meet
the
lips
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
<NUMBER>
years
later
.
He
opened
his
window
,
and
gazed
long
,
with
swelling
heart
,
at
the
<UNK>
vault
of
heaven
,
and
the
moon
,
which
shone
like
silver
upon
the
<UNK>
stream
flowing
from
far
beyond
the
hills
.
He
was
well
again
,
the
poor
invalid
;
the
wretched
captive
was
free
once
more
.
Perhaps
she
touches
with
her
lips
its
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
a
thrill
run
through
his
frame
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
darted
with
<NUMBER>
spring
from
the
window
to
the
door
,
his
lips
met
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

who
told
him
,
with
a
kiss
,
-
``

''
``
Yes

yes

to
run
some

here

''
muttered
he
,
``
my
<PROPER_NOUN>

from
the

at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
It

<PROPER_NOUN>

But
for
the

not
a

must
be
lost
.
``
Give
me
the
letter
,
I
will
direct
it
.
And
in
fact
the
poor
young
people
were
in
great
need
of
protection
.
We
have
seen
him
,
more
successful
under
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
than
under
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
gain
the
friendship
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
for
several
months
he
<UNK>
by
means
of
the
best
<UNK>
ever
<UNK>
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
he
<UNK>
the
suspicion
of
the
jealous
turnkey
by
holding
out
to
him
the
flattering
prospect
of
his
<UNK>
to
marry
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
reader
will
remember
that
the
first
cause
of
uneasiness
was
given
to
the
prisoner
by
the
rage
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
crushed
the
first
bulb
.
Her
discovery
,
however
,
was
made
too
late
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
the
prisoner
himself
that
a
second
bulb
existed
.
And
at
last
he
hired
,
just
opposite
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
window
,
a
little
<UNK>
,
distant
enough
not
to
allow
him
to
be
recognized
with
the
naked
eye
,
but
sufficiently
near
to
enable
him
,
with
the
help
of
his
telescope
,
to
watch
everything
that
was
going
on
at
the
Loewestein
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
,
just
as
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
had
watched
the
dry-room
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
object
could
not
be
anything
else
but
the
second
bulb
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
<UNK>
of
all
the
hopes
of
the
prisoner
.
Another
proof
:
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
afraid
lest
the
soil
should
become
too
dry
.
The
question
,
therefore
,
was
how
to
<UNK>
the
second
bulb
from
the
care
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
For
<NUMBER>
days
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
vain
watched
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
she
was
always
at
her
post
.
We
say
the
theft
,
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
simply
made
up
his
mind
to
steal
the
tulip
;
and
as
it
grew
in
the
most
profound
secrecy
,
and
as
,
moreover
,
his
word
,
being
that
of
a
renowned
tulip-grower
,
would
any
day
be
taken
against
that
of
an
unknown
girl
without
any
knowledge
of
horticulture
,
or
against
that
of
a
prisoner
convicted
of
high
treason
,
he
<UNK>
hoped
that
,
having
once
got
possession
of
the
bulb
,
he
would
be
certain
to
obtain
the
prize
;
and
then
the
tulip
,
instead
of
being
called
Tulipa
nigra
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
would
go
down
to
posterity
under
the
name
of
Tulipa
nigra
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Great
therefore
was
his
joy
when
he
saw
the
usual
evening
meetings
of
the
lovers
resumed
.
He
thought
it
,
therefore
,
better
to
employ
a
different
expedient
.
Boxtel
covered
it
with
a
slight
coat
of
wax
,
and
when
he
thus
renewed
the
experiment
,
the
obstacle
which
prevented
the
key
from
being
turned
a
second
time
left
its
impression
on
the
wax
.
Thus
envy
urged
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
with
rapid
steps
in
the
career
of
crime
.
It
was
not
yet
certain
,
although
very
probable
,
that
the
tulip
would
flower
black
;
if
,
therefore
,
he
stole
it
now
,
he
not
only
might
be
committing
a
useless
crime
,
but
also
the
theft
might
be
discovered
in
the
time
which
must
<UNK>
until
the
flower
should
open
.
Thus
,
every
evening
during
that
delightful
hour
which
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
passed
together
at
the
grated
window
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
chamber
to
watch
the
progress
which
the
black
tulip
had
made
towards
flowering
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
himself
before
Gryphus
with
a
double
supply
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
is
to
say
,
with
a
bottle
in
each
pocket
.
He
did
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
black
tulip
which
was
in
flower
.
Was
she
only
going
to
show
the
tulip
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
He
heard
her
calling
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
extinguish
the
light
and
return
to
her
chamber
.
And
this
is
why
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
,
we
said
that
the
poor
young
people
were
in
great
need
of
the
protection
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Already
did
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
enter
through
the
iron
grating
of
the
prison
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
suddenly
startled
at
the
noise
of
steps
which
came
up
the
staircase
,
and
of
cries
which
approached
nearer
and
nearer
.
she
screamed
,
gasping
for
breath
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
``
Some
<NUMBER>
has
taken
-
stolen
it
from
us
.
''
And
saying
this
,
she
felt
her
limbs
failing
her
,
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
``
And
during
that
time
,
notwithstanding
all
my
<UNK>
,
you
left
the
key
behind
,
unfortunate
child
!
''
``
But
how
did
it
happen
,
then
?
''
She
was
nearly
choking
with
sobs
,
and
was
unable
to
continue
.
No
,
no
;
the
misfortune
is
great
,
but
it
may
perhaps
be
<UNK>
.
``
But
I
say
that
it
is
no
one
else
but
that
infamous
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
How
should
I
,
a
poor
girl
,
with
so
little
knowledge
of
the
world
and
its
ways
,
be
able
to
attain
this
end
,
which
perhaps
you
could
not
attain
yourself
?
''
have
I
the
keys
?
he
is
an
accomplice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
``
I
tell
you
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
I
shall
demolish
this
prison
,
stone
for
stone
!
''
roared
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
only
be
quiet
.
``
My
father
!
''
``
Oh
,
you
villain
!

he
said
,
in
a
voice
choked
with
rage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
communications
with
prisoners
of
state
.
``
Ah
!
''
And
you
have
my
daughter
for
an
accomplice
.
Yes
,
yes
,
just
gnaw
your
paws
like
a
bear
in
his
cage
,
and
you
,
my
fine
little
lady
,
devour
your
dear
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
your
eyes
.
Just
be
quiet
,
-
we
shall
.
''
As
to
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
gradually
loosened
his
hold
of
the
bars
,
which
his
fingers
still
grasped
convulsively
.
He
carried
the
black
tulip
wrapped
up
in
a
cloak
,
and
,
throwing
himself
into
a
coach
,
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
drove
off
,
without
,
as
may
well
be
imagined
,
having
informed
his
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
his
sudden
departure
.
The
flower
was
so
lightly
pressed
upon
all
sides
,
with
a
supply
of
air
from
above
,
that
the
coach
could
now
travel
full
speed
without
any
possibility
of
injury
to
the
tulip
.
She
had
seen
the
despair
of
the
prisoner
,
and
she
knew
that
it
was
derived
from
a
double
source
,
and
that
it
was
<UNK>
.
She
went
to
her
room
,
and
cast
a
last
glance
about
her
to
see
whether
she
had
not
been
mistaken
,
and
whether
the
tulip
was
not
<UNK>
away
in
some
corner
where
it
had
escaped
her
notice
.
Not
being
able
to
procure
a
vehicle
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
obliged
to
take
a
horse
,
with
which
the
<UNK>
readily
intrusted
her
,
knowing
her
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
jailer
of
the
fortress
.
The
honest
lad
was
not
aware
of
the
important
character
of
his
message
;
nevertheless
,
he
used
as
much
speed
as
if
he
had
known
it
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
he
had
already
gone
a
league
and
a
half
.
The
jailer
,
who
was
of
a
very
spiteful
and
cruel
disposition
,
<UNK>
within
himself
at
the
idea
of
having
struck
such
terror
into
his
daughter
's
heart
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
little
with
her
father
since
she
took
care
of
the
tulip
,
that
at
his
dinner
hour
,
that
is
to
say
,
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
he
was
reminded
for
the
first
time
by
his
appetite
that
his
daughter
was
<UNK>
rather
too
long
.
At
that
very
moment
she
entered
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
even
hearing
what
his
jailer
said
,
allowed
himself
to
be
ill-treated
,
abused
,
and
threatened
,
remaining
all
the
while
sullen
,
immovable
,
dead
to
every
emotion
and
fear
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
first
of
all
,
caused
herself
to
be
led
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
announced
simply
as

<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
as
her
name
,
well
as
it
might
sound
,
was
unknown
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
was
refused
admittance
.
He
was
a
spare
little
man
,
resembling
the
stem
of
a
flower
,
his
head
forming
its
<UNK>
,
and
his
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
arms
representing
the
double
leaf
of
the
tulip
;
the
resemblance
was
rendered
complete
by
his
<UNK>
gait
which
made
him
even
more
like
that
flower
when
it
bends
under
a
breeze
.

How

there
was

for
the

with
which
the

generously
treated

Another

an

and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

arrive

halt
for

the

be
called

He
had
so
intently
watched
this
tulip
,
followed
it
so
eagerly
from
the
drawer
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
dry-room
to
the
scaffold
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
from
the
scaffold
to
the
fortress
of
Loewestein
;
he
had
seen
it
<UNK>
and
grow
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
window
,
and
so
often
warmed
the
air
round
it
with
his
breath
,
that
he
felt
as
if
no
one
had
a
better
right
to
call
himself
its
<UNK>

he
had
;
and
any
<NUMBER>
who
would
now
take
the
black
tulip
from
him
would
have
appeared
to
him
as

At
this
solemn
moment
,
and
whilst
the
cheers
still
resounded
,
a
carriage
was
driving
along
the
road
on
the
outskirts
of
the
green
on
which
the
scene
occurred
;
it
pursued
its
way
slowly
,
on
account
of
the
flocks
of
children
who
were
pushed
out
of
the
avenue
by
the
crowd
of
men
and

.
``
What

Then
,
after
some
moments
,
silence
,
during
which
the
carriage
had
proceeded
a
few
yards
,
he
asked
once
more

The

was
about
to
give

order
to
proceed
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
him
,
a
painful
thought
having
struck
him
.
``
Alas

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
throwing

back
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
him
once
more

perhaps
it
will
not
be
much
longer

Oh

I
must
alight

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
more
afraid
for
his
companion
than
himself
,
threw
himself
back
into
the
carriage
,
but
he
could
only
keep
quiet
for
half
a
minute
,
and
the
first
<NUMBER>
horsemen
had
scarcely
passed
when
he
again
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
,
<UNK>
<UNK>
towards
the
Stadtholder
at
the
very
moment
when
he
passed
.
In
an

his

steeds
stood
still
,
at
a
distance
of
about
<NUMBER>
yards
from
the

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<UNK>
.
``
What

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
looking
with
his
cold
glance
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
listened
to
his
anxious
and
urgent
request
.
These
words
of
the
all-powerful
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
by
some
secret
messenger
<UNK>
to
other
<UNK>
had
already
been
apprised

crime
,
seemed
to
him
to
<UNK>
not
only
his
doom
,
but
also
the
refusal
of
his
last
request
.
After
having
granted
this
permission
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
proceeded
on
his
way
over
the
green
amidst
the
most
enthusiastic
acclamations
.
He
saw
it
at
the
distance
of
<NUMBER>
paces
,
and
was
delighted
with
its
perfection
and
<UNK>
;
he
saw
it
surrounded
by
young

who
formed

as

a

for
this

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
trembling

quite
absorbed
in
watching

At

a

arose
on

said
the

Oh

At

there
fell

<PROPER_NOUN>
another

struck

started

The

an

the

themselves

created
such

to

attired

trimmed

beautifully
cut

As

to

entirely
forgotten
that
such

was
pale

occasionally

a

would
overspread
his

a

contraction
<UNK>
his
features
,
while

with
an

restless
gaze

he
would
glance
in

like

either
anticipated

foresaw
some

<NUMBER>

<UNK>
lashes

so
as

have
concealed
the
liquid

her
animated

,
on

the
delighted

looked
around
her
with

During

at

had
been

placing
his

the

carried

<PROPER_NOUN>
herself

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose

nature
received

betrayed
each

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
bride
blushed
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
restless
and
uneasy
,
seemed
to
start
at
every
fresh
sound
,
and
from
time
to
time
wiped
away
the
large
drops
of
perspiration
that
gathered
on
his
brow
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
pleased
and
gratified
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
grasped
the
handle
of
his
knife
with
a
convulsive
<UNK>
.
``
Why
,
thus
it
is
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
closed
his
eyes
,
a
burning
sensation
passed
across
his
brow
,
and
he
was
compelled
to
support
himself
by
the
table
to
prevent
his
falling
from
his
chair
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
a
deep
groan
,
which
,
however
,
was
lost
amid
the
noisy
felicitations
of
the
company
.
``
But
,
''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
timid
tone
,
``
how
did
you
manage
about
the
other
formalities

the
contract

the

This
joke
elicited
a
fresh
burst
of
applause
.
To-morrow
morning
I
start
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
<NUMBER>
days
to
go

the

with
<NUMBER>
day
to
discharge
the
commission
intrusted

is
all
the

Around
the
table
reigned
that
noisy
hilarity
which
usually
<UNK>
at
such
a
time
among
people
sufficiently
free
from
the
demands
of
social
position
not
to
feel
the
<UNK>
of
etiquette
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
,
he
seemed
to
be
<UNK>
the
tortures
of
the
damned
;
unable
to
rest
,
he
was
among
the
first
to
quit
the
table
,
and
,
as
though
seeking
to
avoid
the
<UNK>
mirth
that
rose
in
such
deafening
sounds
,
he
continued
,
in
utter
silence
,
to
pace
the
farther
end
of
the
salon
.
``
Oh
,
there
was
no
harm
meant
,
''
answered
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
;
``
at
first
I
certainly
did
feel
somewhat
uneasy
as
to

I
saw
how
completely

mastered
his

<PROPER_NOUN>

I
only
wish

would
let
me
take
his
place

-
to
be
sure

''
At
the
same
instant
his
ear
caught
a
sort
of
indistinct
sound
on
the
stairs
,
followed
by
the
measured
tread
of
<UNK>
,
with
the
<UNK>
of
swords
and
military
<UNK>
;
then
came
a
<UNK>
and
buzz
as
of
many
voices

so
as
to
<UNK>
even
the
noisy
mirth
of
the
<UNK>
party
,
among
whom
a
vague
feeling
of
curiosity
and
apprehension
<UNK>
every
disposition
to
talk
,
and
almost
instantaneously
the
most
deathlike
stillness
prevailed
.
``
I
demand
admittance
,
''
said
a
loud
voice
outside
the
room
,
``
in
the
name
of

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
addressing
the
magistrate

whom
he
evidently
knew
;
``
there
is
doubtless
some
mistake
easily
explained

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

replied
the
magistrate
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
that
further
resistance

<UNK>
was
useless
.
He
prayed
and
supplicated
in
terms
so
moving
,
that
even
the
officer
was
touched
,
and
,
although
firm
in
his
duty
,
he
kindly
said

The
painful
catastrophe
he
had
just
witnessed
appeared
effectually
to
have
rent
away
the
veil
which
the
intoxication
of
the
evening
before
had
raised
between

''
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
communicated
with
the
prison
,
-
a
sombre
edifice
,
that
from
its

windows
looks
on
the
<UNK>
of
the

The
air

inhaled
was
no

pure
,

thick
and
<UNK>
,
-
he
was
in
prison

The
obscurity
augmented
the
acuteness

his

;
at
the

sound
he
rose
and
hastened
to

convinced

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
folded
his

raised
his

prayed
fervently

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

knew

had

His

forced

the

carrying

heard
the

as
they
passed
before

he
saw
the

there
,
his

swollen
with
weeping

<PROPER_NOUN>
started

The

stared

``
Do

All
his

then
burst
forth
;
he
cast
himself
on
the
ground
,
weeping
bitterly
,
and
asking
himself
what
crime
he
had
committed
that
he
was
thus
punished

He
spoke
Italian
like

he

all

over
the

This

delighted
<PROPER_NOUN>

It

prevented

putting

<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
the

the

contracted

<PROPER_NOUN>
in
his

heard
the
noise

preparation

sounds

would

of

The
universal

The

the

He
did
not
move
at
the
sound
of
the
door

and
continued
his
calculations
until
the
flash
of
the
torches
lighted
up
with
an
<UNK>
glare
the
sombre
walls
of
his
cell
;
then
,
raising
his

he
perceived
with
astonishment
the

``
Very

Could

``

he

addressing
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

the

,
``
I

returned
the

this

``
I

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
that
acuteness

``
A

''
Then
turning
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
``
I
inquired

repeated
the
inspector
.
``
You

the
inspector
.
The
turnkey
closed
the
door
behind
them
.
``
After
all
,
''
said
the

,
``
if

But
the
kings
of
modern

,
restrained
by
the
limits
of
mere
probability

have
neither
courage
nor
desire

As
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
rarely
allowed
its
victims
to
be
seen
with
their
limbs
distorted
and
their
flesh
<UNK>
by
torture
,
so
madness
is
always
concealed
in
its
cell
,
from
whence
,
should
it
depart
,
it
is
conveyed
to
some
gloomy
hospital
,
where
the
doctor
has
no
thought
for
man
or
mind
in
the
mutilated
being
the
jailer
<UNK>
to
him
.
This
note
was
in
a
different
hand
from
the
rest
,
which
showed
that
it
had
been
added
since
his
confinement
.
This
fortnight
expired
,
he
decided
that
the
inspector
would
do
nothing
until
his
return
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
that
he
would
not
reach
there
until
his
circuit
was
finished
,
he
therefore
fixed
<NUMBER>
months
;
<NUMBER>
months
passed
away
,
then
<NUMBER>
more
.
A
new
governor
arrived
;
it
would
have
been
too
tedious
to
acquire
the
names
of
the
prisoners
;
he
learned
their
numbers
instead
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
always
the
last
resource
.
His
requests
were
not
granted
,
but
he
went
on
asking
all
the
same
.
He
now
wished
to
be
amongst
them
,
in
order
to
see
some
other
face
besides
that
of
his
jailer
;
he
sighed
for
the
galleys
,
with
the
infamous
costume
,
the
chain
,
and
the
brand
on
the
shoulder
.
The
jailer
,
though
rough
and
hardened
by
the
constant
sight
of
so
much
suffering
,
was
yet
a
man
.
He
prayed
,
and
prayed
aloud
,
no
longer
terrified
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
,
for
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
ecstasy
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
man
of
great
simplicity
of
thought
,
and
without
education
;
he
could
not
,
therefore
,
in
the
solitude
of
his
dungeon
,
traverse
in
mental
vision
the
history
of
the
ages
,
bring
to
life
the
nations
that
had
perished
,
and
<UNK>
the
ancient
cities
so
vast
and
stupendous
in
the
light
of
the
imagination
,
and
that
pass
before
the
eye
glowing
with
celestial
colors
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<UNK>
pictures
.
He
clung
to
<NUMBER>
idea
-
that
of
his
happiness
,
destroyed
,
without
apparent
cause
,
by
an
unheard-of
fatality
;
he
considered
and
<UNK>
this
idea
,
devoured
it
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
,
as
the
implacable
<UNK>
<UNK>
the
skull
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
told
himself
that
it
was
the
enmity
of
man
,
and
not
the
vengeance
of
heaven
,
that
had
thus
plunged
him
into
the
deepest
misery
.
Before
him
is
a
dead
sea
that
<UNK>
in
azure
calm
before
the
eye
;
but
he
who
<UNK>
<UNK>
within
its
embrace
finds
himself
struggling
with
a
monster
that
would
drag
him
down
to
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
some
<UNK>
in
these
ideas
.
Then
I
felt
that
my
vessel
was
a
vain
refuge
,
that
trembled
and
shook
before
the
tempest
.
No
sooner
had
this
idea
taken
possession
of
him
than
he
became
more
composed
,
arranged
his
couch
to
the
best
of
his
power
,
ate
little
and
slept
less
,
and
found
existence
almost
<UNK>
,
because
he
felt
that
he
could
throw
it
off
at
pleasure
,
like
a
<UNK>
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
always
entertained
the
greatest
horror
of
pirates
,
who
are
hung
up
to
the
<UNK>
;
he
would
not
die
by
what
seemed
an
infamous
death
.
``
When
my
morning
and
evening
meals
are
brought
,
''
thought
he
,
``
I
will
cast
them
out
of
the
window
,
and
they
will
think
that
I
have
eaten
them
.
''
It
was
the
last
<UNK>
for
life
contending
with
the
resolution
of
despair
;
then
his
dungeon
seemed
less
sombre
,
his
prospects
less
desperate
.
He
persisted
until
,
at
last
,
he
had
not
sufficient
strength
to
rise
and
cast
his
supper
out
of
the
loophole
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
a
sort
of
stupor
creeping
over
him
which
brought
with
it
a
feeling
almost
of
content
;
the
gnawing
pain
at
his
stomach
had
ceased
;
his
thirst
had
abated
;
when
he
closed
his
eyes
he
saw
<UNK>
of
lights
dancing
before
them
like
the
<UNK>
'
-
<UNK>
that
play
about
the
marshes
.
It
was
a
continual
scratching
,
as
if
made
by
a
huge
<UNK>
,
a
powerful
tooth
,
or
some
iron
instrument
attacking
the
stones
.
No
,
no
,
doubtless
he
was
deceived
,
and
it
was
but
<NUMBER>
of
those
dreams
that
<UNK>
death
!
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
intensely
interested
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
himself
up
and
began
to
talk
about
everything
;
about
the
bad
quality
of
the
food
,
about
the
coldness
of
his
dungeon
,
grumbling
and
complaining
,
in
order
to
have
an
excuse
for
speaking
louder
,
and
<UNK>
the
patience
of
his
jailer
,
who
out
of
kindness
of
heart
had
brought
<UNK>
and
white
bread
for
his
prisoner
.
Oh
,
if
I
were
only
there
to
help
him
!
''
Unfortunately
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
brain
was
still
so
feeble
that
he
could
not
bend
his
thoughts
to
anything
in
particular
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
replaced
on
the
table
the
bread
he
was
about
to
devour
,
and
returned
to
his
couch

he
did
not
wish

If

it

the
noise
I
make
will
alarm

cease

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
intently
;
an
hour
passed
,
<NUMBER>
hours
passed
,
and
no
sound
was
heard
from
the
wall
-
all

The

passed
in
perfect
silence

<NUMBER>
days
passed

<NUMBER>
long
tedious

he
counted
off
by

Something
was
at
work
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
;
the
prisoner
had
discovered
the
danger
,
and
had
substituted
a
lever
for

.
All
his
furniture
consisted
of
a
bed
,
a
chair
,
a
table
,
a
<UNK>
,
and
a

.
He
let
the
jug
fall
on

,
and
it
broke
in
pieces
.
All
night
he
heard
the
subterranean
workman
,
who
continued
to
mine
his
way
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
joyfully
the
key
<UNK>
in
the

he
listened
until
the

of
steps
died
away
,
and
then
,
hastily
<UNK>
his

,
saw
by
the
faint
light
that
penetrated
into
his

that
he
had
labored
uselessly
the

evening
in
attacking
the

removing
the

that
surrounded
it

In
<NUMBER>
days
he
had
succeeded
,
with

in
removing

and
exposing
the

The
fragments
of
the
jug
broke
,
and
after
an
hour
of
useless
toil
,
he
paused
.
The
handle
of
this
saucepan
was
of
iron
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
given
<NUMBER>
years
of
his

.
He
was
wrong
to
leave
it
there
,
but
the
jailer
was
wrong
not
to
have
looked
before
him
.
This
advice
was
to
the
jailer
's
taste
,
as
it
spared
him
the
necessity
of
making
another
trip
.
A
slight
<UNK>
showed
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
all
went
well
.
At
the
dawn
of
day
he
replaced
the
stone
,
pushed
his
bed
against

,
and
lay
down
.
``
No

''
replied
the
turnkey
;
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
clasped
his

beneath

coverlet

When
the
hour
for
his
jailer
's
visit
arrived
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
the

of
the

as
well
as

could
,
and
placed
it
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
wished
to
ascertain
whether
his

The

made
no

,
but
met
with
a
smooth
surface
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
touched
it
,
and
found
that

murmured
he
,
``

that

stood

<PROPER_NOUN>

murmured
the

;

the

He
was
,
perhaps
,
about
to
regain
his

;
at
the

,
he
would
have
a

At

he
bounded

he
;

the

<UNK>
in
his

the

so
long

ardently
desired

<PROPER_NOUN>
almost
carried
him
towards
the

in

to
obtain
a

view
of
his

by
the
aid
of
the
imperfect

that
struggled
through

<UNK>
drops

now
standing
on

the

were
so

could
only
guess
at

he
,

``

``

This

had
contrived

At

Dantes
resolved

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>

A

escaped

the

Those

this

The

down

They

On

The

lasted
<NUMBER>

At

a

The

he

He

Since

returned
next

on

Then

His

But

<NUMBER>
day

His

The

He

``

raising

The

cast
himself
on

leaning
his

against
the

I
see
it
in

A

clasping

convulsively

Besides

And
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
.
When
he
believed
that
the
right

had
arrived

he
took
the

,
<UNK>
open
the
teeth
,
which
offered
less
resistance
than
before

counted
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
<NUMBER>
drops
,
and
watched
;
the
phial
contained
,
perhaps
,
twice
as
much
more
.
The
draught
produced
a
<UNK>
effect
,
a
violent
trembling
pervaded
the

's
limbs
,
his
eyes
opened
until
it
was
fearful
to
gaze
upon

,
he
heaved
a
sigh
which
resembled
a
shriek
,
and
then
his
convulsed
body
returned
gradually
to
its
former
<UNK>
,
the
eyes
remaining
open
.
While
the
struggle
between
day
and
night
lasted
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
doubted
;
but
as
soon
as
the
daylight
gained
the
<UNK>
,
he
saw
that
he
was
alone
with
a

On
this
occasion
he
began
his
rounds
at

cell

and
on
leaving

he
went
on

taking

breakfast

some

He

returned
by

and
arrived
in
time
to
hear
the
exclamations
of
the

who
called
out
for

The

then
went
out

on

listening

mingled
with

said
another
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
lose
a
word
,
but
comprehended
very
little
of
what
was
said
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
,
he
heard
a
faint
noise
,
which
increased
.
The
doctor
<UNK>
the
symptoms
of
the
malady
to
which
the

had
succumbed
,
and
declared
that
he
was
dead

``
Still

''
said
the
governor
,
``
I
believe
it
will
be
requisite
,
notwithstanding
your

and
not
that
I
doubt
your

discharge
of

that

''
``
You

said
the

,
<UNK>
,
``
that

He
heard
hasty
steps
,
the
creaking
of
a
door
,
people
going
and
coming
,
and
some
minutes
afterwards
a
turnkey
entered
,
saying
,
-
``
Here
is
the

''
The
poor

is
cured
of
his
folly
,
and
delivered

''
He
was
,
too
,
very
learned
,
and
rational
enough
on
all
points
which
did
not
relate
to
his
treasure
;
but
on
that
,
indeed
,
he
was
<UNK>
.
''
``
Never

sir
,
''
replied
the
jailer
,
``
never

on
the

he
sometimes
amused

``
Certainly

``
Will

I
told
him
I
would
attend
to
the

in
his
absence
.
A
shout
of
laughter
followed
this
brutal
jest
.
inquired
a
turnkey
.
Shut
the
dungeon
as
if
he
were
alive
-
that
is
all
.
''
On
the
bed
,
at
full
length
,
and
faintly
illuminated
by
the
pale
light
that
came
from
the
window
,
lay
a
sack
of
canvas
,
and
under
its
rude
folds
was
stretched
a
long
and
stiffened
form
;
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
last
winding-sheet
,
-
a
winding-sheet
which
,
as
the

said
,
cost
so
little

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
<UNK>
and
cheerful
companion
,
with
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
live
so
intimately
,
no

breathed
.
-
never
again
to
see
the
face
,
never
again
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
only
human
being
who
united
him
to
earth
!
But
how
to
die
?
``
Die
?
No
,
I
want
to
live
;
I
shall
struggle
to
the
very
last
;
I
will
yet
win
back
the
happiness
of
which
I
have
been
deprived
.
Suddenly
he
arose
,
lifted
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
his
brain
wore
giddy
,
paced
twice
or
thrice
round
the
dungeon
,
and
then
paused
abruptly
by
the
bed
.
Since
none
but
the
dead
pass
freely
from
this
dungeon
,
let
me
take
the
place
of
the
dead
!
''
In
that
case
his
last
hope
would
have
been
destroyed
.
He
hoped
that
the
weight
of
earth
would
not
be
so
great
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
.
The
first
risk
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
was
,
that
the
jailer
,
when
he
brought
him
his
supper
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
might
perceive
the
change
that
had
been
made
;
fortunately
,
<NUMBER>
times
at
least
,
from
misanthropy
or
fatigue
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
received
his
jailer
in
bed
,
and
then
the
man
placed
his
bread
and
soup
on
the
table
,
and
went
away
without
saying
a
word
.
From
time
to
time
chills
ran
through
his
whole
body
,
and
clutched
his
heart
in
a
grasp
of
ice
.
At
length
,
about
the
hour
the
governor
had
appointed
,
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
.
The
<NUMBER>
men
,
approaching
the
ends
of
the
bed
,
took
the
sack
by
its
extremities
.
inquired
the
first
speaker
.
``
What
's
the
knot
for
?
''
Suddenly
he
felt
the
fresh
and
sharp
night
air
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
that
the
<UNK>
was
blowing
.
``
Where
am
I
?

<PROPER_NOUN>
'
first
impulse
was
to
escape

but
fortunately
he
did
not
attempt
it

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Yes

''
was
the
answer
,
``
but
it
has
lost
nothing
by
waiting
.
''
``
Yes
,
and
pretty
tight
too
,
I
can
tell
you
,
''
was
the
answer
.
The
noise
of
the
waves
dashing
against
the
rocks
on
which
the
chateau
is
built
,
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
ear
distinctly
as
they
went
forward
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
comprehend
the
jest
,
but
his
hair
stood
erect
on
his
head
.
They
ascended
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
more
steps
,
and
then
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
felt
that
they
took
him
,
<NUMBER>
by
the
head
and
the
other
by
the
heels
,
and
swung
him
to
and
fro
.
And
at
the
same
instant
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
himself
flung
into
the
air
like
a
wounded
bird
,
falling
,
falling
,
with
a
rapidity
that
made
his

<UNK>
.
The
sea
is
the
cemetery
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
waited
only
to
get
breath
,
and
then
dived
,
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
.
He
fancied
that
these
<NUMBER>
forms
were
looking
at
the
sea
;
doubtless
these
strange
grave-diggers
had
heard
his
cry
.
He
must
now
get
his
bearings
.
At
this
moment
he
saw
the
light
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
in
front
of
him
like
a
star
.
These
words
rang
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
ears
,
even
beneath
the
waves
;
he
hastened
to
<UNK>
his
way
through
them
to
see
if
he
had
not
lost
his
strength
.
He
fancied
that
every
wave
behind
him
was
a
pursuing
boat
,
and
he
redoubled
his
exertions
,
increasing
rapidly
his
distance
from
the
chateau
,
but
<UNK>
his
strength
.
``
Let
us
see
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
swum
above
an
hour
,
but
as
the
wind
is
against
me

that
has
<UNK>
my

;
however
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
I
must
be
close
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
swim
on
until
I
am
worn
out
,
or
the
<UNK>
seizes
me
,
and
then
I
shall
sink
;
''
and
he
struck
out
with
the
energy
of
despair
.
Before
him
rose
a
grotesque
mass
of
rocks
,
that
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
vast
fire
petrified
at
the
moment
of
its
most
fervent
<UNK>
.
Then
,
in
spite
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
he
fell
into
the
deep
,
sweet
sleep
of
utter
<UNK>
.
He
knew
that
it
was
barren
and
without
shelter
;
but
when
the
sea
became
more
calm
,
he
resolved
to
plunge
into
its
waves
again
,
and
swim
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
equally
<UNK>
,
but
larger
,
and
consequently
better
<UNK>
for
concealment
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
island
trembled
to
its
base
,
and
that
it
would
,
like
a
vessel
at
anchor
,
break
<UNK>
,
and
bear
him
off
into
the
centre
of
the
storm
.
By
its
light
,
between
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
quarter
of
a
league
distant
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
a
fishing-boat
driven
rapidly
like
a
spectre
before
the
power
of
winds
and
waves
.
The
men
he
beheld
saw
him
undoubtedly
,
for
their
cries
were
carried
to
his
ears
by
the
wind
.
Then
all
was
dark
again
.
It
was
day
.
It
was
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
.
Then
boats
filled
with
armed
soldiers
will
pursue
the
wretched
fugitive
.
I
have
lost
even
the
knife
that
saved
me
.
She
was
coming
out
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
harbor
,
and
was
standing
out
to
sea
rapidly
,
her
sharp
prow
cleaving
through
the
waves
.
under
pretext
of
<UNK>
along
the
coast
,
these
men
,
who
are
in
reality
smugglers
,
will
prefer
selling
me
to
doing
a
good
action
.
I
can
pass
as
<NUMBER>
of
the
sailors
<UNK>
last
night
.
It
an
instant
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
plan
was
formed
.
And
this
conviction
restored
his
strength
.
He
rose
on
the
waves
,
making
signs
of
distress
;
but
no
one
on
board
saw
him
,
and
the
vessel
stood
on
another
tack
.
Then
he
advanced
;
but
before
they
could
meet
,
the
vessel
again
changed
her
course
.
An
instant
after
,
the
boat
,
rowed
by
<NUMBER>
men
,
advanced
rapidly
towards
him
.
He
shouted
again
.
The
water
passed
over
his
head
,
and
the
sky
turned
gray
.
When
he
opened
his
eyes
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
himself
on
the
deck
of
the
tartan
.
As
we
have
said
,
he
was
lying
on
the
deck
.
``
Who

The

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
dived
into

wanted

At

that
with

At
first
the

had
received
<PROPER_NOUN>
on

with
a
certain
degree
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
thus
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
what
the

was

without
the

knowing
who
he
was

and
however
the

tried
to
``

him
,
they
<UNK>
nothing

he
gave

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
he
knew
as

and
held
stoutly
to
his

Here
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
undergo
another
trial

he
was
to
find
out
whether
he
could
recognize
himself
,
as
he
had
not
seen
his

for

The

gazed
in
amazement
at
this

with
the
long
,
thick
and
black
hair
and
beard
,
which
gave
his

the
appearance

He
was
now
,
as
we

his
<NUMBER>
years
'
imprisonment
had
produced
a

transformation
in

To
the
elegance

had
succeeded
the

But
the

There
they

the

in

enemy

He

and
,
whether
from
heat

blood
produced
by
the
encounter

or
the

this

had
made

the

soon
closed

And
from

the

left

what

<PROPER_NOUN>
replied

<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
more
agile

than

among

disturbed

he
sprang
from

the
base

<PROPER_NOUN>
of
himself
.
Then
he
descended
,
a
smile
on

and
murmuring
that

``

But
he
called
to

the

knew

He
reflected
that

must
penetrate
deeper
into

he
examined

sounded

He
again
struck

<PROPER_NOUN>
struck
with

entered

between

The

was
deserted

seemed
to
cover
it
with
its
fiery
glance
;
afar
off
,
a
few
small
fishing
boats
studded
the
bosom
of
the
blue
ocean
.
He
had
nothing
more
to
do
now
,
but
with
the
iron
tooth
of
the
pickaxe
to
draw
the
stones
towards
him
<NUMBER>
by
<NUMBER>
.
He
waited
in
order
to
allow
pure
air
to
displace
the
foul
atmosphere
,
and
then
went
on
.
The
treasure
,
if

was
buried
in

Never

At

a

passed
rapidly

the
opening
;
Dantes
seized
his

,
sprang
through
the
opening
,
and
mounted

He
wished
to
see
everything

In
an

a

cleared

all
the
Italian
armorial
bearings
,
and
surmounted
by

cardinal

hat
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
easily
recognized
them
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
so
often
drawn
them
for
him

He
sought
to
open
it
;
lock
and
<UNK>
were
fastened
;
these
faithful
guardians
seemed
unwilling
to
surrender
their
trust
.
He
then
closed
his
eyes
as
children
do
in
order
that
they
may
see
in
the
resplendent
night
of
their
own
imagination
more
stars
than
are
visible
in
the
firmament
;
then
he
<UNK>
them
,
and
stood
motionless
with
amazement
.
He
was
alone
-
alone
with
these
<UNK>
,
these
unheard-of
treasures
!
He
soon
became
calmer
and
more
happy
,
for
only
now
did
he
begin
to
realize
his
felicity
.
And
he
measured
<NUMBER>
double
handfuls
of
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
other
gems
,
many
of
which
,
mounted
by
the
most
famous
workmen
,
were
valuable
beyond
their
<UNK>
worth
.
Day
,
for
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
so
eagerly
and
impatiently
waited
with
open
eyes
,
again
dawned
.
This
done
,
he
impatiently
awaited
the
return
of
his
companions
.
He
then
inquired
how
they
had
fared
in
their
trip
.
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
the
trip
had
been
sufficiently
successful
to
satisfy
all
concerned
;
while
the
crew
,
and
particularly
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
expressed
great
regrets
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
an
equal
<UNK>
with
themselves
in
the
profits
,
which
amounted
to
no
less
a
sum
than
<NUMBER>
piastres
each
.
The
following
day
Dantes
presented
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
an
entirely
new
vessel
,
accompanying
the
gift
by
a
donation
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
piastres
,
that
he
might
provide
himself
with
a
suitable
crew
and
other
<UNK>
for
his
outfit
,
upon
condition
that
he
would
go
at
once
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
after
an
old
man
named
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
residing
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
also
a
young
woman
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
an
inhabitant
of
the
Catalan
village
.
The
following
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
set
sail
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
directions
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
join
him
at
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
the
moment
of
his
arrival
a
small
yacht
was
under
trial
in
the
bay
;
this
yacht
had
been
built
by
order
of
an
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
having
heard
that
the
Genoese
excelled
all
other
<UNK>
along
the
shores
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
construction
of
<UNK>
vessels
,
was
desirous
of
possessing
a
specimen
of
their
skill
;
the
price
agreed
upon
between
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
Genoese
builder
was
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
led
the
owner
of
the
yacht
to
the
dwelling
of
a
Jew
;
retired
with
the
latter
for
a
few
minutes
to
a
small
back
parlor
,
and
upon
their
return
the
Jew
counted
out
to
the
<UNK>
the
sum
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
in
bright
gold
pieces
.
But
their
wonder
was
soon
changed
to
admiration
at
seeing
the
perfect
skill
with
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
handled
the
helm
.
Yet
thither
it
was
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
guided
his
vessel
,
and
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
arrived
at
the
close
of
the
second
day
;
his
boat
had
proved
herself
a
<UNK>
sailer
,
and
had
come
the
distance
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
<NUMBER>
hours
.
A
week
passed
by
.
As
it
drew
near
,
he
recognized
it
as
the
boat
he
had
given
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
dead
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
disappeared
.
For
his
father
's
death
he
was
in
some
manner
prepared
;
but
he
knew
not
how
to
account
for
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<NUMBER>
fine
morning
,
then
,
his
yacht
,
followed
by
the
little
fishing-boat
,
boldly
entered
the
port
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
anchored
exactly
opposite
the
spot
from
whence
,
on
the
<UNK>
night
of
his
departure
for
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
been
put
on
board
the
boat
destined
to
convey
him
thither
.
<UNK>
straight
towards
him
,
he
<UNK>
a
variety
of
questions
on
different
subjects
,
carefully
watching
the
man
's
countenance
as
he
did
so
;
but
not
a
word
or
look
implied
that
he
had
the
slightest
idea
of
ever
having
seen
before
the
person
with
whom
he
was
then
conversing
.
``
Thank
you
,
my
good
friend
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
meanwhile
,
went
on
his
way
.
<UNK>
himself
,
however
,
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brows
,
and
stopped
not
again
till
he
found
himself
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
his
father
had
lived
.
Though
answered
in
the
negative
,
he
begged
so
earnestly
to
be
permitted
to
visit
those
on
the
fifth
floor
,
that
,
in
spite
of
the
<UNK>
assurance
of
the
concierge
that
they
were
occupied
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
succeeded
in
<UNK>
the
man
to
go
up
to
the
tenants
,
and
ask
permission
for
a
gentleman
to
be
allowed
to
look
at
them
.
The
young
couple
gazed
with
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
their
visitor
's
emotion
,
and
wondered
to
see
the
large
tears
silently
chasing
each
other
down
his
otherwise
stern
and
immovable
features
;
but
they
felt
the
<UNK>
of
his
grief
,
and
kindly
refrained
from
questioning
him
as
to
its
cause
,
while
,
with
instinctive
delicacy
,
they
left
him
to
indulge
his
sorrow
alone
.
The
very
same
day
the
occupants
of
the
apartments
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
house
,
now
become
the
property
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
were
duly
informed
by
the
notary
who
had
arranged
the
necessary
transfer
of
deeds
,
etc.
,
that
the
new
landlord
gave
them
their
choice
of
any
of
the
rooms
in
the
house
,
without
the
least
<UNK>
of
rent
,
upon
condition
of
their
giving
instant
possession
of
the
<NUMBER>
small
chambers
they
at
present
inhabited
.
The
delighted
<UNK>
of
these
<UNK>
gifts
would
gladly
have
poured
out
their
thanks
to
their
generous
benefactor
,
but
they
had
seen
him
,
upon
quitting
the
hut
,
merely
give
some
orders
to
a
sailor
,
and
then
springing
lightly
on
horseback
,
leave
<PROPER_NOUN>
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
few
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
<UNK>
struggled
hard
for
existence
,
but
their
withered
dusty
foliage
abundantly
proved
how
unequal
was
the
conflict
.
For
about
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
years
the
little
tavern
had
been
kept
by
a
man
and
his
wife
,
with
<NUMBER>
servants
,
-
a
chambermaid
named
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
a
hostler
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
naturally
dark
complexion
had
assumed
a
still
further
shade
of
brown
from
the
habit
the
unfortunate
man
had
acquired
of
<UNK>
himself
from
morning
till
eve
at
the
threshold
of
his
door
,
on
the
lookout
for
guests
who
seldom
came
,
yet
there
he
stood
,
day
after
day
,
exposed
to
the
<UNK>
rays
of
a
burning
sun
,
with
no
other
protection
for
his
head
than
a
red
handkerchief
twisted
around
it
,
after
the
manner
of
the
Spanish
<UNK>
.
She
remained
nearly
always
in
her
<UNK>
chamber
,
shivering
in
her
chair
,
or
stretched
languid
and
feeble
on
her
bed
,
while
her
husband
kept
his
daily
watch
at
the
door
-
a
duty
he
performed
with
so
much
the
greater
<UNK>
,
as
it
saved
him
the
necessity
of
listening
to
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
murmurs
of
his
<UNK>
,
who
never
saw
him
without
breaking
out
into
bitter
<UNK>
against
fate
;
to
all
of
which
her
husband
would
calmly
return
an
<UNK>
reply
,
in
these
philosophic
words
:
-
``
Hush
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Like
other
<UNK>
in
the
south
,
he
was
a
man
of
sober
habits
and
moderate
desires
,
but
fond
of
external
show
,
vain
,
and
<UNK>
to
display
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
was
,
as
usual
,
at
his
place
of
observation
before
the
door
,
his
eyes
glancing
listlessly
from
a
piece
of
closely
<UNK>
grass
-
on
which
some
fowls
were
<UNK>
,
though
<UNK>
,
endeavoring
to
turn
up
some
grain
or
insect
suited
to
their
palate
-
to
the
deserted
road
,
which
led
away
to
the
north
and
south
,
when
he
was
aroused
by
the
shrill
voice
of
his
wife
,
and
grumbling
to
himself
as
he
went
,
he
mounted
to
her
chamber
,
first
taking
care
,
however
,
to
set
the
entrance

wide
open
,
as
an
invitation
to
any
chance
traveller
who
might
be

The

was

he
tied

safely
and
having
drawn
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
,
from
his
pocket
,
wiped
away
the
perspiration
that
streamed
from
his
brow
,
then
,
advancing
to
the
door
,
struck
thrice
with
the
end
of
his
<UNK>
stick
.
repeated
the
astonished
Caderousse
.
I
make
no
doubt
a
glass
of
good
wine
would
be
acceptable
this
dreadfully
hot
day
.
''
What
refreshment
can
I
offer
?
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
rejoined
the
priest
.
``
And
you
followed
the
business
of
a

?
''
``
Yes
;
let
me
have
a

with
your

resume
our
conversation
from
where
we
left
off

''
inquired
the
guest
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
before
him
the
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
.
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a
sigh
,
``
it
is
easy
to
perceive
I
am
not
a

the
better
for
being
honest

''
``
Such

those
belong

answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
you
do
well
to
repeat

added
he
,
with
a
bitter
expression
of
countenance
,
``
<NUMBER>
is
free
to
believe

not

pleases

''
``
In
the
first

I
must
be
satisfied

Did
I
know

Is

''
There
was
a
brief
silence
,
during
which
the
fixed
,
searching
eye
of
the
abbe
was
employed
in
scrutinizing
the
agitated
features
of
the
inn-keeper
.
``
And
of
what
did
he
die

''
``
But
the
strangest
part

is

resumed
the
abbe

``
that

``
And
for

he
besought

penetrate

clear
his
memory

``
Then

I
suppose

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>

with
eager

glowing

``
that
it

I
have
it

``
It

replied
the
abbe

as
he
closed
the
box
,
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
,
while
its
brilliant
hues
seemed
still
to
dance
before
the
eyes
of
the
fascinated
inn-keeper

I
once
possessed

he
said

I
feel
convinced

grieved
over
my

A
<UNK>
smile
played
over
the
features
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
about
to
break
in
upon
the
abbe

speech

when
the

waving

said

But
to
return
to
these
registers

''
For
the
story
?
``
Yes
,
you
will
much
oblige
me

''
The
inspector
begged
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
seat
himself
in
an
arm-chair
,
and
placed
before
him
the
register
and
documents
relative
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
giving
him
all
the
time
he
desired
for
the
examination
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
seated
himself
in
a
corner
,
and
began
to
read
his
newspaper
.
Then
he
saw
through
the
whole
thing
.
To
be
kept
in
strict
solitary
confinement
,
and
to
be
closely
watched
and
guarded
.
As
we
have
said
,
the
inspector
,
from
discretion
,
and
that
he
might
not
disturb
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
pupil
in
his
researches
,
had
seated
himself
in
a
corner
,
and
was
reading
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
rose
,
gave
his
seat
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
took
it
without
ceremony
,
and
quickly
drew
up
the
required
assignment
,
while
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
counted
out
the
bank-notes
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
.
<NUMBER>
was
a
young
man
of
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
and
<NUMBER>
,
who
was
in
love
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
daughter
,
and
had
remained
with
him
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
his
friends
to
induce
him
to
withdraw
;
the
other
was
an
old
<UNK>
cashier
,
called
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
or
``
<UNK>
,
''
a
<UNK>
given
him
by
the
young
men
who
used
to
throng
this
vast
now
almost
deserted
<UNK>
,
and
which
had
so
completely
replaced
his
real
name
that
he
would
not
,
in
all
probability
,
have
replied
to
any
<NUMBER>
who
addressed
him
by
it
.
But
this
did
not
arise
from
a
want
of
affection
;
on
the
contrary
,
from
a
firm
conviction
.
Nothing
had
as
yet
occurred
to
shake
Cocles
'
belief
;
the
last
month
's
payment
had
been
made
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactitude
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
detected
an
<UNK>
of
<NUMBER>
sous
in
his
cash
,
and
the
same
evening
he
had
brought
them
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
threw
them
into
an
almost
empty
drawer
,
saying
:
-
``
Thanks
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
you
are
the
pearl
of
<UNK>
.
''
By
this
means
the
end
of
the
month
was
passed
,
but
his
resources
were
now
exhausted
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
him
;
this
young
man
was
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
every
new
face
,
for
every
new
face
might
be
that
of
a
new
creditor
,
come
in
anxiety
to
question
the
head
of
the
house
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
first
,
and
the
stranger
followed
him
.
``
Yes
;
I
think
so
,
at
least
,
''
said
the
young
girl
hesitatingly
.
The
young
girl
turned
pale
and
continued
to
descend
,
while
the
stranger
and
Cocles
continued
to
mount
the
staircase
.
<NUMBER>
years
had
changed
the
worthy

,
who
,
in

year
at

was
now
in

his

on

and
his
look

once
so
firm
and
penetrating
,
was
now
<UNK>
and
wandering
,
as
if
he
feared
being
forced
to
fix
his
attention
on
some
particular
thought
or
person

``

the

taking

The

remained

<PROPER_NOUN>
trembling
in
every

the

gazing
at

The
young

did
not
speak
;
but
she
made
an
affirmative
sign
with
her
head
as
she
lay
on
her
father

breast
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
<NUMBER>
hands
to

with
an

Scarcely
had
he
uttered
those

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
weeping
bitterly
.
``
How
did
this
happen

``
Good-day

rolled

advanced

<UNK>
himself
,
and
began

-

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
he
,
``
we

It

`

thus
<UNK>
the

said
the

The
captain
descended
last
,
or
rather
,
he
did
not
descend
,
he
would
not
quit
the
vessel
;
so
I

round

<PROPER_NOUN>

that

``

``

These

produced

<PROPER_NOUN>

The
<NUMBER>
women
looked
at
this
person
whose
presence
they
had
entirely
forgotten
,
and
retired
;
but
,
as
she
left
the
apartment

<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
the

a
supplicating

to
which

``

''
``

``

said
he
.
To-day

These

were
uttered
in
so
low
a

that
the

could
not
hear
them
.
``
Oh

said
she

clasping
her
hands

``
Come
with
me

my

''
said
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
I
wish
to
speak
to
you

''
When
he
thought
the
matter
over
,
he
could
by
no
means
account
for
this
generous
conduct
on
the
part
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
&
<PROPER_NOUN>
towards
him
;
and
could
only
attribute
it
to
some
such
selfish
argument
as
this
:
-
``
We
had
better
help
a

owes

nearly
<NUMBER>

It
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
who
remembered
with
alarm
,
that
if
he
had
to
repay
on
the
15th
the
<NUMBER>
francs
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
on
the

the
<NUMBER>

of
bills
,
for
which
,
as
well
as
the
debt
due
to
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
he
had
time
granted
,
he
must
be
a
ruined
man
.
The
month
passed
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
extraordinary
efforts
to
get
in
all
his
resources
.
The
agent
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
&
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
again
seen
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
the
day
after
,
or
<NUMBER>
days
after
his
visit
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
disappeared
;
and
as
in
that
city
he
had
had
no
intercourse
but
with
the
mayor
,
the
inspector
of
prisons
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
departure
left
no
trace
except
in
the
memories
of
these
<NUMBER>
persons
.
The
worthy
shipowner
knew
,
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
recital
,
of
the
captain
's
brave
conduct
during
the
storm
,
and
tried
to
console
him
.
When
he
saw
his
<UNK>
,
the
worthy
<UNK>
seemed
much
embarrassed
,
drew
on
<NUMBER>
side
into
the
corner
of
the
landing-place
,
passed
his
quid
from
<NUMBER>
cheek
to
the
other
,
stared
<UNK>
with
his
great
eyes
,
and
only
acknowledged
the
squeeze
of
the
hand
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
usual
gave
him
by
a
slight
pressure
in
return
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
went
away
,
``
may
your
new
master
love
you
as
I
loved
you
,
and
be
more
fortunate
than
I
have
been
!
''
There
came
in
,
moreover
,
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fully
anticipated
,
and
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
as
punctually
as
the
bills
which
the
shipowner
had
accepted
.
It
was
said
at
this
moment
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
worth
from
<NUMBER>
to
<NUMBER>
millions
of
francs
,
and
had
unlimited
credit
.
Yet
,
on
his
arrival
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
utter
a
complaint
,
or
say
<NUMBER>
harsh
word
.
The
poor
women
felt
instinctively
that
they
required
all
their
strength
to
support
the
blow
that
<UNK>
.
He
had
at
once
declared
for
a
military
life
,
and
had
in
consequence
studied
hard
,
passed
brilliantly
through
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
left
it
as
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
of
the
line
.
This
was
the
young
man
whom
his
mother
and
sister
called
to
their
aid
to
sustain
them
under
the
serious
trial
which
they
felt
they
would
soon
have
to
endure
.
A
moment
afterwards
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
him
go
up-stairs
carrying
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
heavy
ledgers
,
a
portfolio
,
and
a
bag
of
money
.
However
,
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
down
to
his
dinner
,
he
appeared
very
calm
.
For
part
of
the
day
he
went
into
the
court-yard
,
seated
himself
on
a
stone
with
his
head
bare
and
exposed
to
the
<UNK>
sun
.
They
listened
;
he
went
into
his
sleeping-room
,
and
fastened
the
door
inside
.
``
He
is
writing
,
''
she
said
.
Next
day
M.
<PROPER_NOUN>
seemed
as
calm
as
ever
,
went
into
his
office
as
usual
,
came
to
his
breakfast
punctually
,
and
then
,
after
dinner
,
he
placed
his
daughter
beside
him
,
took
her
head
in
his
arms
,
and
held
her
for
a
long
time
against
his
bosom
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
trembled
at
this
request
,
which
seemed
to
her
of
bad
omen
.
``
Nothing
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
the
unhappy
man
,
the
tears
starting
to
his
eyes
at
this
simple
question
,
-
``
nothing
,
only
I
want
it
.
''
``
Do
not
give
this
key
to
your
father
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
to-morrow
morning
,
if
possible
,
do
not
quit
him
for
a
moment
.
''
The
mother
and
daughter
passed
the
night
together
.
They
did

The

rushed
out

on

she
found

The

hastily
took
the

She
read
:

Yet

through

it

giving

Then
a

came

took

conveyed
him
to
a

splendidly
fitted
up

on

he
sprung
with

thence
he

weeping

was
shaking

around

thanking
with
a

the

At
these
words
he
gave
a

,
as

only
awaiting
this

,
the
yacht
instantly
put
out

<PROPER_NOUN>

replied
that

on

offered

shot
out
of
the
harbor
like

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
disembarked
at

As
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
sufficient

were
not

he
accepted
the

the

The

the

soon
sailing
in

direction
of

the

you
understand
now

said
the
captain
,
``
why
no

never

Bah

The
wind
blew
strongly
,
the
boat
made
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
knots
an
hour
,

they
were
rapidly
reaching
the
end

their

Little
by

the
shadow
rose
higher

seemed
to
drive
before

the

the
expiring
day

at

the
reflection
rested
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain

where
it
paused
an

like
the
fiery
crest

a
volcano

then
gloom
gradually
covered
the
summit
as
it
had
covered
the
base
,
and
the
island
now
only
appeared
to
be
a
gray
mountain
that
grew
continually
darker

half
an
hour
after

the
night
was
quite
dark

asked
he
.
``

``
But
this

``
If

only
from

``
You
shall

All
this
was
done
in
silence
,
and
from
the
moment
that
their
course
was
changed
not
a
word
was
spoken
.
This

soon
disappeared
;
it
was
evident

touched

he
;

viewed
his

it
was
a

The
sailors
had
again
hoisted
sail
,
and
the
vessel
was
once
more
cleaving
the
waves
.
At
the
first
words
of
the
song
the
men
seated
round
the
fire
arose
and
approached
the
landing-place
,
their
eyes
fixed
on

,
evidently
seeking
to
know
who

what

<PROPER_NOUN>
coolly
cocked
both
barrels

The

was
<UNK>
to
the
shore
,
and
they
advanced
a
few
paces
to
find
a
comfortable

;
but
,
doubtless
,
the
spot
they
chose
did
not
suit
the
smuggler
who
filled
the

,
for
he
cried
out
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
lowered
a
torch

saw
by

pondered
the

concluded

said
a

which
he
recognized

sentinel

<UNK>
he
was
made
to
promise
that
he
would
not

Presently
,
by
a
change
in
the
atmosphere

he
knew
that
they
were
entering
a
cave

after
going
on
for

more
he
heard
a

,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
the

again
changed

became
<UNK>
and
perfumed

It
may
be
supposed
,
then
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
wait
for
a
repetition

took
off
the

found

dressed
in
a
<UNK>
costume
-
that
is
to
say
,
a
red
cap
with
a

blue
silk
<UNK>
,
a

of
black
cloth
embroidered
with
gold

pantaloons

large

full
<UNK>
of
the

embroidered
with

he
had
a

round
his

and
a

passed
through

But
what
astonished
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
treated
<PROPER_NOUN>

description
as
a

was
the
splendor
of
the

he
found

he
said

after

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
was
present

acquitted
himself
so
admirably

the

complimented
his

``

Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
brought
on
the
dessert

took

placed

He
replaced

casting

As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
strange
transformation
had
taken
place
in
him
.
He
descended
,
or
rather
seemed
to
descend
,
several
steps
,
inhaling
the
fresh
and
<UNK>
air
,
like
that
which
may
be
supposed
to
reign
around
the
grotto
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
formed
from
such
perfumes
as
set
the
mind
a
dreaming
,
and
such
fires
as
burn
the
very
senses
;
and
he
saw
again
all
he
had
seen
before
his
sleep
,
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
singular
host
,
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
mute
attendant
;
then
all
seemed
to
<UNK>
away
and
become
confused
before
his
eyes
,
like
the
last
shadows
of
the
magic
lantern
before
it
is
extinguished
,
and
he
was
again
in
the
chamber
of
statues
,
lighted
only
by
<NUMBER>
of
those
pale
and
antique
lamps
which
watch
in
the
dead
of
the
night
over
the
sleep
of
pleasure
.
Then
the
<NUMBER>
statues
advanced
towards
him
with
looks
of
love
,
and
approached
the
couch
on
which
he
was
<UNK>
,
their
feet
hidden
in
their
long
white
<UNK>
,
their
<UNK>
bare
,
hair
flowing
like
waves
,
and
assuming
<UNK>
which
the
gods
could
not
resist
,
but
which
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
and
looks
inflexible
and
ardent
like
those
with
which
the
serpent
charms
the
bird
;
and
then
he
gave
way
before
looks
that
held
him
in
a
<UNK>
grasp
and
delighted
his
senses
as
with
a
voluptuous
kiss
.
When
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
to
himself
,
he
seemed
still
to
be
in
a
dream
.
He
advanced
several
paces
towards
the
point
whence
the
light
came
,
and
to
all
the
excitement
of
his
dream
succeeded
the
calmness
of
reality
.
He
was
for
some
time
without
reflection
or
thought
for
the
divine
charm
which
is
in
the
things
of
nature
,
<UNK>
after
a
fantastic
dream
;
then
gradually
this
view
of
the
outer
world
,
so
calm
,
so
pure
,
so
grand
,
reminded
him
of
the
<UNK>
of
his
vision
,
and
once
more
awakened
memory
.
Otherwise
,
his
head
was
perfectly
clear
,
and
his
body
refreshed
;
he
was
free
from
the
slightest
headache
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
felt
a
certain
degree
of
lightness
,
a
faculty
for
absorbing
the
pure
air
,
and
enjoying
the
bright
sunshine
more
vividly
than
ever
.
So
saying
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
pointed
in
a
direction
in
which
a
small
vessel
was
making
sail
towards
the
southern
point
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
was
attired
as
he
had
been
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
waved
his
<UNK>
to
his
guest
in
token
of
adieu
.
observed
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
he
is
bidding
you
adieu

''
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
light
a

''
he
added
,
``

give

He
saw
nothing
,
unless
that
,
by
traces
of
smoke
,
others
had
before
him
attempted
the
same
thing
,
and
,
like
him
,
in

When
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
again
on
the
shore
,
the
yacht
only
seemed
like
a
small
white
speck
on
the
horizon
.
These
animals
,
though
wild
and
agile
as
<UNK>
,
were
too
much
like
domestic
goats
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
consider
them
as
game
.
The
second
visit
was
a
long
<NUMBER>
,
and
when
he
returned
the
kid
was
roasted
and
the
repast
ready
.
``
True

and
he
is
going
to
land
them
,
''
added
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
And
what
cares
he
for
that
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a
laugh
,
``
or
any

It
was
perfectly
clear

then
supper

An

down

Scarcely

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>

smiling
at

<NUMBER>
day
,
when
he
was
<NUMBER>
years
old
,
he
came
to
the
curate
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
asked
to
be
taught
to
read
;
it
was
somewhat
difficult
,
for
he
could
not
quit
his
flock
;
but
the
good
curate
went
every
day
to
say
mass
at
a
little
hamlet
too
poor
to
pay
a
priest
and
which
,
having
no
other
name
,
was
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
told
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
might
meet
him
on
his
return
,
and
that
then
he
would
give
him
a
lesson
,
warning
him
that
it
would
be
short
,
and
that
he
must
profit
as
much
as
possible
by
it
.
This
was
not
enough
-
he
must
now
learn
to
write
.
At
the
end
of
<NUMBER>
months
he
had
learned
to
write
.
With
this
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
purchased
books
and
<UNK>
.
The
<NUMBER>
children
met
,
sat
down
near
each
other
,
let
their
flocks
mingle
together
,
played
,
laughed
,
and
conversed
together
;
in
the
evening
they
separated
the
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
flock
from
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
children
returned
to
their
respective
<UNK>
,
promising
to
meet
the
next
morning
.
<UNK>
his
taste
for
the
fine
arts
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
carried
as
far
as
he
could
in
his
solitude
,
he
was
given
to
<UNK>
fits
of
sadness
and
enthusiasm
,
was
often
angry
and
capricious
,
and
always
sarcastic
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
lively
and
gay
,
but
coquettish
to
excess
.
Thus
,
in
all
their
dreams
,
their
wishes
,
and
their
conversations
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
himself
the
captain
of
a
vessel
,
general
of
an
army
,
or
governor
of
a
province
.
The
steward
gave
him
a
gun
;
this
was
what
<PROPER_NOUN>
longed
for
.
For
a
long
time
a
gun
had
been
the
young
man
's
greatest
ambition
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
this
exploit
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the
dead
animal
on
his
shoulders
,
and
carried
him
to
the
farm
.
And
yet
the
<NUMBER>
young
people
had
never
declared
their
affection
;
they
had
grown
together
like
<NUMBER>
trees
whose
roots
are
mingled
,
whose
branches
<UNK>
,
and
whose
<UNK>
perfume
rises
to
the
heavens
.
The
brigands
have
never
been
really
<UNK>
from
the
neighborhood
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Many
young
men
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
disappeared
.
The
bandit
's
laws
are
positive
;
a
young
girl
belongs
first
to
him
who
carries
her
off
,
then
the
rest
draw
lots
for
her
,
and
she
is
abandoned
to
their
brutality
until
death
<UNK>
her
sufferings
.
However
,
as
he
was
a
favorite
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
had
for
<NUMBER>
years
faithfully
served
him
,
and
as
he
had
saved
his
life
by
shooting
a
dragoon
who
was
about
to
cut
him
down
,
he
hoped
the
chief
would
have
pity
on
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
there
,
however
,
by
accident
,
as
he
said
,
and
had
carried
the
maiden
off
.
<NUMBER>
hours
'
delay
was
all
that
was
granted
-
that
is
,
until
<NUMBER>
the
next
morning
.
The
boy
undertook
the
commission
,
promising
to
be
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
less
than
an
hour
.
A
cold
perspiration
burst
from
every
<UNK>
,
and
his
hair
stood
on
end
.
After
a
<NUMBER>
yards
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
thicket
;
he
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
senseless
in
the
arms
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
lay
between
them
.
`
At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
to-morrow
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
father
will
be
here
with
the
money
.

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
-
`
But
never
mind
,
'
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
laughing
,
`
sooner
or
later
your
turn
will
come
.
'
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
departed
,
without
losing
sight
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
,
doubtless
,
he
feared
lest
he
should
strike
him
<UNK>
;
but
nothing
betrayed
a
hostile
design
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
part
.
`
Let
us
draw
lots
!
The
eyes
of
all
shone
fiercely
as
they
made
their
demand
,
and
the
red
light
of
the
fire
made
them
look
like
demons
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
himself
thus
favored
by
fortune
,
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
.
-
`
Well
done
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
'
They
turned
round
,
and
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
bearing
the
young
girl
in
his
arms
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
amidst
the
most
profound
silence
,
and
laid
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
the
captain
's
feet
.
`
Ah
,
ah
,
'
said
the
chief
,
`
I
now
understand
why
<PROPER_NOUN>
stayed
behind
.
'
-
`
No
,
'
returned
the
chief
,
`
she
is
<UNK>
.
'
It
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
father
,
who
brought
his
daughter
's
ransom
in
person
.
They
both
advanced
beneath
the
trees
,
through
whose
branches
streamed
the
moonlight
.
At
length
he
advanced
toward
the
group
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
.
`
I
expected
thee
,
'
said
the
bandit
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
father
.
A
ray
of
moonlight
poured
through
the
trees
,
and
lighted
up
the
face
of
the
dead
.
-
`
Thou
hast
done
well
!
'
`
Now
,
'
said
the
old
man
,
`
aid
me
to
bury
my
child
.
'
Then
,
when
they
had
finished
,
they
cast
the
earth
over
the
corpse
,
until
the
grave
was
filled
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
obeyed
,
rejoined
his
comrades
,
folded
himself
in
his
cloak
,
and
soon
appeared
to
sleep
as
soundly
as
the
rest
.
He
went
toward
the
place
where
he
had
left
him
.
There
was
some
surprise
,
however
,
that
,
as
he
was
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
,
he
should
have
received
a
ball
between
his
shoulders
.
Thus
,
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
every
<NUMBER>
trembles
at
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
were
both
orphans
,
and
had
only
their
<UNK>
'
leave
to
ask
,
which
had
been
already
sought
and
obtained
.
They
knew
full
well
that
this
fugitive
must
be
a
bandit
;
but
there
is
an
<UNK>
sympathy
between
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
brigand
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
peasant
and
the
latter
is
always
ready
to
aid
the
former
.
They
had
seen
no
one
.
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
brigadier
;
`
and
as
his
head
is
valued
at
a
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN>
crowns
,
there
would
have
been
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
for
you
,
if
you
had
helped
us
to
catch
him
.
'
`
Yes
,
it
is
very
annoying
,
'
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
`
but
we
have
not
seen
him
.
'
He
had
read
in
the
countenances
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
their
steadfast
resolution
not
to
surrender
him
,
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
purse
full
of
gold
,
which
he
offered
to
them
.
The
time
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
at
hand
.
This
was
granted
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
wore
the
very
picturesque
garb
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
peasant
at
holiday
time
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
attired
like
a
woman
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
were
attired
as
peasants
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
pointed
out
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
hanging
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
arm
in
a
group
of
peasants
.
-
<UNK>
turned
towards
the
young
man
who
was
talking
with
her
,
and
saying
a
few
words
to
him
,
pointed
with
her
finger
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Certainly
,
in
the
eyes
of
an
artist
,
the
exact
and
strict
costume
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
a
very
different
character
from
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
her
companions
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
frivolous
and
coquettish
,
and
thus
the
embroidery
and
<UNK>
,
the
cashmere
<UNK>
,
all
dazzled
her
,
and
the
reflection
of
sapphires
and
diamonds
almost
turned
her
giddy
brain
.
When
they
spoke
,
although
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
timidly
and
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
conversation
of
her
cavalier
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
read
in
the
ardent
looks
of
the
<UNK>
young
man
that
his
language
was
that
of
praise
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
world
was
turning
round
with
him
,
and
all
the
voices
of
hell
were
whispering
in
his
ears
ideas
of
murder
and
assassination
.
``
The
young
peasant
girl
,
at
first
timid
and
<UNK>
,
soon
recovered
herself
.
Twice
or
thrice
during
the
dance
the
young
girl
had
glanced
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
each
time
she
saw
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
features
were
agitated
,
once
even
the
blade
of
his
knife
,
half
drawn
from
its
sheath
,
had
dazzled
her
eyes
with
its
sinister
glare
.
The
truth
was
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
felt
the
strength
to
support
another
such
trial
,
and
,
half
by
persuasion
and
half
by
force
,
he
had
removed
<PROPER_NOUN>
toward
another
part
of
the
garden
.
However
,
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
great
astonishment
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
mute
,
and
not
a
word
escaped
his
lips
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
-
`
He
said
it
only
depended
on
myself
to
have
it
,
and
I
had
only

word
to

''
-
`
Well
,
then

you
shall
have
it
!

``
That
night
a
<UNK>
event
occurred
,
due
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
imprudence
of
some
servant
who
had
neglected
to
extinguish
the
lights
.
When
she
recovered
,
her
father
was
by
her
side
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
greatly
troubled
that
she
had
not
recognized
him

He
came
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
high
spirits
,
and
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
the
events
of
the
previous
evening
.
The
young

,
perceiving
that
there
was
something
extraordinary
,
looked
at
him
steadfastly
.
-
`
Yes
,
'
replied
the
young
girl
,
whose
astonishment
increased
at
every
word
uttered
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
`
but
of
course
your
reply
was
only
to
please
me

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
,
and
,
without
inquiring
whence
this
attire
came
,
or
even
thanking
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
darted
into
the
grotto
,
transformed
into
a
dressing-room
.
The
traveller
,
who
was
going
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
mistaken
his
way
;
the
young

directed
him
;
but
as
at
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
road
again
divided
into
<NUMBER>
ways
,
and
on
reaching
these
the
traveller
might
again
stray
from

he
begged
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
be
his

``
That

For

it
is
hardly

he
said

<PROPER_NOUN>
said
no

``
Vampa
put
the
<NUMBER>
sequins
haughtily
into
his
pocket
,
and
slowly
returned
by
the
way
he
had
gone

The
cry
proceeded
from
the
grotto
.
This
man
,
who
was
hastening
towards
the
wood
,
was
already
three-quarters
of
the
way
on
the
road
from
the
grotto
to

The
young

rose
instantly
,
but
the
man
lay
on
the
earth
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
death
.
He
had
just
expired

with
clinched
hands
,
his
mouth
in
a
spasm
of
agony
,
and
his

on
end
in

From

and
profiting
by
the

when
her

had
left
her
alone

off

pierced

At

his

-
The

did
so
without

conducting
her

for

Vampa
smiled
disdainfully
at
this
precaution
on

the
bandit

went
before

and
continued
to
advance
with
the

easy
step
as

-
`
Good

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
reached

all
at

found

reply
.
-
`
Yes
,
but
I
came
to
ask
something
more

The
bandits
shouted
with
laughter
.
An

afterwards

was

rising

lighting
his

``

This

possessed
another

in

his

But
however
the

;
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
have
been
so
much
the
more
difficult
to
break
their

,
as
the

alone
are
permitted
to
visit
these

with

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
remained
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perfectly
hidden
by
the
shadow
of
the
vast
column
at
whose
base
he
had
found
a
resting-place
,
and
from
whence
his
eyes
followed
the
motions
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his

,
who
,
holding
torches
in

had
emerged
from
a

at

opposite
extremity
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
then
again
disappeared
down
the
steps
conducting
to
the
seats
reserved
for
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
resembling
,
as
they
glided
along
,
some
restless
shades
following
the
flickering
glare
of
so
many
<UNK>
.
The
stranger
thus
presenting
himself
was
probably
a
person
who
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
preferred
the
enjoyment
of
solitude
and
his
own
thoughts
to
the
frivolous
<UNK>
of
the
guides
.
Around
this
opening
,
which
had
,
possibly
,
for
ages
permitted
a
free
entrance
to
the
brilliant
moonbeams
that
now
illumined
the
vast
pile
,
grew
a
quantity
of
creeping
plants
,
whose
delicate
green
branches
stood
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
clear
azure
of
the
firmament
,
while
large
masses
of
thick
,
strong
<UNK>
<UNK>
forced
their
way
through
the
<UNK>
,
and
hung
floating
to
and
fro
,
like
so
many
waving
strings
.
From
the
imperfect
means
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
of
judging
,
he
could
only
come
to
<NUMBER>
conclusion
,
-
that
the
person

he
was
thus
watching
certainly
belonged
to
no

``

the

in

from

However
much

have
claimed
his
attention
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
too
deeply
occupied
with
the
beautiful
Greek
to
take
any
note
of
it
;
while
she
seemed
to
experience
an
almost
childlike
delight
in
watching

her
eager

animated

<UNK>
strongly
with
the
utter

during

never

not

when
the

<UNK>
din
produced
by

the

slowly
arise

a

him

then
,
leaning
forward
again
on
the
<UNK>
of
her
box
,
she
became
as
absorbed

in
what
was
going

The

he

The

sat
appeared
to

opening

we

out

then
passed
it

his

A
double
line
of
carbineers

placed
on
each
side
of
the
door
of
the

to
the

a

around
it

leaving
a
path
about
<NUMBER>
feet
wide
,
and
around
the
guillotine
a
space
of
nearly
a

What
the

said
was
true

the
most
curious

him

He
looked
at

he
was
as
white
as
his

and
mechanically
cast
away
his
cigar
,
although
he
had
not
half
<UNK>
it
.
However

the

advanced
,

their

became

The

assistants
had
borne
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
scaffold
,
and
there
,
in
spite
of
his
struggles
,
his
bites
,
and
his
cries
,
had
forced
him
to
his
knees
.
At
every
stroke
a
jet
of
blood
sprang
from
the
wound
.
When
<PROPER_NOUN>
recovered
his
senses
,
he
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
drinking
a
glass
of
water
,
of
which
,
to
judge
from
his
pallor
,
he
stood
in
great
need
;
and
the

who
was
assuming
his
masquerade
costume

``
Nothing

replied
the

;
``

``

He
profited
by
this
distraction
to
slip
away
among
the
crowd
,
without
even
thanking
the
worthy
priests
who
accompanied
him
.
``
Well

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
do
you

join

``
Without
reflecting
that
this
is
the
only

can

said
the

;
``
on

off
the

been
worn
through

He
assumed
his
costume
,
and
fastened
on
the
mask
that
scarcely
equalled
the
pallor
of
his
own
face
.
Instead
of
the
spectacle

gloomy
and
silent

,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
presented
a
spectacle

They
saw
,

continued
to

,
the
image

what
they
had
witnessed
;

little
by

the
general

seized
them
,

they
felt
themselves
obliged

take
part
in
the
noise

confusion

As
for
the

of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
never
for
an
instant
shown
any
appearance
of
having
been
moved

In

the

dressed
in
the
most
fantastic

gigantic

walk
gravely
about

<UNK>

walk
on

in

this
a

is
lifted
,
and
,
as
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a

face
is
exhibited

which
we

At

the

with
white
damask
with
a

was
a

beneath

<PROPER_NOUN>

easily
pictured
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
thanked
the

``
What

``
How

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;

He
instantly
rose
and
cast
the

into
the

``
Well

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
him
;
``
there
is
the

The

however

soon
appeared
to
become

for
when
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
again
encountered
the

the

clapped

The

sat
down

remarking
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

At

gave
up

A
glance
at
the

proved
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
was
a
connoisseur

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
charmed
with

manners

and
he
was
only
prevented
from
recognizing
him
for

by
reason

At

they
hastened
into

<PROPER_NOUN>
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
when

he

He
did

one

She

<PROPER_NOUN>
remarked

while

gave
these

that
<PROPER_NOUN>
seemed
to
have
something
to
ask
of
him
,
but
that

was
unwilling

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not

in

so

This
belief
was
changed
into

when
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the

conspicuous
by
a

white
<UNK>
-RRB-
in
the
hand
of
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
was

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
about
to
discuss
seriously
his
right
to
the
<UNK>
chair
when
they
were
informed
that
dinner
was
ready
.
They
had
not
seen
him
for
<NUMBER>
days
.
Whether
he
kept
a

over
himself
,
or
whether
by

he
did

sound
the

<UNK>
that
in

he
was
to-night
like
everybody

The

had
learned
that
the
<NUMBER>
friends
had
sent
to
secure
a
box
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
were
told
they
were
all
let

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
by
degrees
become
accustomed
to
the
count
's
pallor
,
which
had
so
forcibly
struck
him
at
their
first
meeting
.
His
forehead
was
marked
with
the
line
that
indicates
the
constant
presence
of
bitter
thoughts
;
he
had
the
fiery
eyes
that
seem
to
penetrate
to
the
very
soul
,
and
the
haughty
and
disdainful
upper
lip
that
gives
to
the

it
<UNK>
a
peculiar
character
that
<UNK>
them
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
constantly
<UNK>
on
their
good
fortune
in
meeting
such
a
man
.
The
evening
passed
as
evenings
mostly
pass
at
Italian
theatres
;
that
is
,
not
in
listening
to
the
music
,
but
in
paying
visits
and
conversing
.
The
<UNK>
of
the
bouquet
kept
her
word
;
she
gave
<PROPER_NOUN>
no
sign
of
her
existence
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
.
From
<NUMBER>
o'clock
till
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
followed
in
the
fete
,
exchanging
handfuls
of
confetti
with
the
other
carriages
and
the
<UNK>
,
who
crowded
amongst
the
horses
'
feet
and
the
carriage
wheels
without
a
single
accident
,
a
single
dispute
,
or
a
single
fight
.
A
knot
of
rose-colored
ribbons
fell
from
his
shoulder
almost
to
the
ground
.
It
was
a
human
storm
,
made
up
of
a
thunder
of
cries
,
and
a
hail
of
sweetmeats
,
flowers
,
eggs
,
<UNK>
,
and
<UNK>
.
All
these
evolutions
are
executed
with
an
inconceivable
address
and
marvellous
rapidity
,
without
the
police
<UNK>
in
the
matter
.
Almost
instantly
,
in
the
midst
of
a
tremendous
and
general
<UNK>
,
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
horses
,
excited
by
the
shouts
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
spectators
,
passed
by
like
lightning
.
The
<UNK>
of
moccoletti
entered
on
the
scene
.
The
moccoletto
is
kindled
by
approaching
it
to
a
light
.
The
night
was
rapidly
approaching
;
and
already
,
at
the
cry
of
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

It
seemed
like

Had

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
out

bearing
his
moccoletto
in

hand
.
Instantly
a
mask
,
wearing
the
well-known
costume
of
a
peasant
woman
,
snatched
his
moccoletto
from
him
without
his
offering
any
resistance
.
It
seemed
as
though
<NUMBER>
immense
blast
of
the
wind
had
extinguished
every

In
his
whole
life
,
perhaps
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
never

experienced
so
sudden
an

so
rapid
a
transition

<UNK>
was
waiting

but
as

had
told

<PROPER_NOUN>
sat
down

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
and
then
moreover
,
what
could
happen

``

He
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
messenger
from
<PROPER_NOUN>

inquired
the
man
,
retreating
a
step
or
<NUMBER>

as
if
to
keep

``
Your

``
Is
there
any

``
I
prefer

the
messenger
,
with
a
smile
.
``
Certainly

said
the
landlord
.
he
asked
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
young
man
had
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
looking
very
much
alarmed
,
and
this
had
only
made
him
the
more
anxious
to
read

letter
;
and
so
he
went
instantly
towards
the
<UNK>

unfolded
it

<PROPER_NOUN>
to

draw
from

instantly

<NUMBER>
piastres

and
give
them
to
the
bearer

<UNK>
-
I
now
believe
in
Italian
banditti

This
second
signature
explained
everything
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
now
understood
the
objection
of
the
messenger
to
coming
up
into
the
apartment
;
the
street
was
safer
for
him

There
were

about

did
not
perceive
the

spread
itself
over

his
chest

it

She
doubtless
intended

surprise

strange

taken

accompanied

made
,
then
,
while
he
stamped
with
his
feet
to
remove
all
traces
of
his
occupation
,
I
rushed
on
him
and
plunged
my
knife
into
his
breast
,
exclaiming
,
-
`
I
am
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
thy
death
for
my
brother

;
thy
treasure
for
his

;
thou
<UNK>
that
my
vengeance
is
more
complete
than
I
had
hoped
.
'
``
Ah

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
``

seems
to

``
Ah

I
recollect

replied
the
count
;
``
did
you
not

something

After
a

I
fancied
that
I
felt
a
slight
pulsation
of
the
heart
,
and
as
I
had
been
assistant
at
the
hospital
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
did
what
a
doctor
would
have
done
-
I
<UNK>
the
lungs
by
blowing
air
into
them
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
it
began
to
breathe
,
and
cried
feebly
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
No
objection
was
raised
,
but
they
pointed
out
the
asylum
,
which
was
situated
at
the
upper
end
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
after
having
taken
the
precaution
of
cutting
the
linen
in
<NUMBER>
pieces
,
so
that
<NUMBER>
of
the
<NUMBER>
letters
which
marked
it
was
on
the
piece
wrapped
around
the
child
,
while
the

remained
in
my
possession
,
I
rang
the
bell
,
and
fled
with
all
speed
.
``
What

were
marked

''
``
In

wished
to

<NUMBER>
things
;
what
was
the

?
''
you

I
take

''
We
profited
by
this
respite
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
friends
everywhere
.
And
in
my
past
life
they
might
find
something

``
No

I
questioned
her

in

she
would
tell
me
nothing

I
departed

For
the
assassination
itself
I
had
never

Ah

I
confess

your

when

sleeping

I

Never

it
was
not

For

the

who
knew

had
taken
it
into

I
became
angry
;
he
began
to
laugh
,
I
threatened
to
strike
him
,
and
he
made
<NUMBER>
steps
backwards
.
When
I
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
everything
went
on
properly
,

no

was
my
back
turned

<PROPER_NOUN>
became

everything

I
hoped

called

<UNK>
,
who
had
lost
sight
of
me
near
the
tavern
;
feeling
certain
that
I
intended
to
pass
the
night
there
,
he
had
returned
to
summon
his
comrades

who
just
arrived
in

to
hear
the
report

the

and
to
take
me
in

rendered
all

utterly
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
still
<UNK>
all
pursuit

I
had
resigned
myself
to
what
seemed
my

And
then
it
was
that

won
by
his
mild
charity
,
seeing
that
he
was
acquainted
with
all
the
habits
and
customs
of
my
own
country
,
and
considering
also
that
pardon
for
the
only
crime
of
which
I
was
really
guilty
might
come
with
a
double
power
from
lips
so
benevolent
and
kind
,
I
besought
him
to
receive
my
confession
,
under
the
seal
of
which
I
recounted
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
affair
in
all
its
details
,
as
well
as
every

``
I
had

<UNK>
by

Would

like
such

I
extended
my

,
and
was
about
to

by
any

he
would
dictate
,
but
he
stopped
me
.
``
I

<UNK>
as

suppose
I
was

behold

my

I
lost
no

hastening
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
when
I
arrived
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
I
found
a

of
mourning
,
the
consequences
of
a
scene
so
horrible
that
the
neighbors
remember
and
speak
of
it
to
this
day
.
``
As
the
<UNK>
hour
struck
,
he
entered
with
a
<UNK>
air
,
attended
by
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
of
his
boon
companions
.
The

proceeded
to

the

,
then
returned
,
and
the
<NUMBER>
united
in
stifling
the

terror
<UNK>
by
the
sight
of
these

and
then
dragged
<PROPER_NOUN>
feet
foremost
towards
the
<UNK>

expecting
to
wring
from
her
an
avowal
of
where
her

<PROPER_NOUN>
never

appeared
at

anything

``

committed

answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
this
instant
a
shudder
passes
over
me
as
I
reflect
that
possibly
I
am
now
standing
on
the
very
grave
in
which
lies
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

was

he
added
,
bowing
his

``

As

I
see

point
in

My

directly
I
had
succeeded
in
recalling
the

was
to
restore

to
its

,
in

do
so

I
must
have
made
close

inquiry

which
would

in

have
led
to
my
own
apprehension

I
clung
to
life

partly
on

and
partly
from

in

After
a

silence

rendered
still
more
solemn
by
the
time

place
,
the

said
,
in
a
tone

wholly

The

hastily
descended

presented
himself
at

held
out
his

His

He
stationed
himself
in
a
room
commanding
a
view
of
the
street
,
pacing
the
chamber
with
restless
steps
,
stopping
merely
to
listen
from
time
to
time
for
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels

then
to
cast

glance
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
the
regularity
with
which
the
Nubian
puffed
forth
the
smoke
of
his
chibouque
proved
that
he
at

was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
favorite
occupation
.
The
carriage
creaked
and
rattled
as
it
flew
over
the
rough
stones
,
and
the
slightest
obstacle
under
the
wheels
would
have
caused

it
kept
on
in

middle

road

and
those

saw
it
pass
uttered
cries

The
brief
space
had

been
sufficient
for

followed
by
a

to
rush
from
the
house
before
which
the
accident
had
occurred

and
,
as
the

opened

a

kept
folded
in
her
arms

<UNK>
on
him
the
most
tender

His
first
movement
was
to
free

by
a
violent
push
from
the
<UNK>
arms
of
his
mother

and
to
rush
forward
to
the
casket
from
whence
the

had
taken
the
phial

elixir
;
then
,
without
asking
permission
of

he
proceeded
,
in
all
the
<UNK>
of
a
spoiled
child
unaccustomed
to
restrain
either

caprices
,
to
pull
the
<UNK>
out
of
all
the
bottles

At
sight
of
him
Madame
de
Villefort
uttered
an
expression
of
pleasure
,
and
,
holding
the
child
still
closer
towards
her

she
said
,
``

Then

commencing
a
loud
whistling
noise
,
he
rubbed
them
well
all
over
their
bodies
for
several
minutes
;
then
,
undisturbed
by
the
noisy

collected
round
the
broken

<PROPER_NOUN>
quietly
harnessed
the

to

took

mounted

to

utter

of
those
who
had
witnessed
the

spirit

maddened
speed
of

he
was
actually

even

all

supposed

The

looked
at
her
for
an

with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
tenderness

then
,
turning
towards
the

he
significantly
winked
his

said
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at

exclaimed

The
winking
of
the
eyes
which
answered
this

was
most
decided
and
terrible

and
expressed
a
feeling
almost
amounting
to

notaries
looked
at

mute
astonishment

The

rested
on

who
was
the

to
break
the

This

the

chilled
the

The

Everything

seemed
to
have
its

scarcely

No

speak

the

thought
she
was
about

address
him

both

silent

after

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
directed

received

And
for

talent
are
they
celebrated

I
can
assure
you
the

made
a
great
noise
in

the

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;

so
this

Certainly

kissed

drew
near

And
she
left
the
room

She
went
straight
to
the
group
of
which
her
husband
formed
the
centre
.
Turning
towards

<PROPER_NOUN>

she
added

Behind

by

a

rushed
into

asked

The

looked
at

as

interrogate
her

she
continued
to
walk
on
in
silence

he
refrained
from
speaking

The

bowed

stepped
back

fall

and
sighed

The

again
refused

``

added
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a
supplicating
glance
,
``

Occasionally
he
shuddered
;
he
thought
of
the

from

he
should
protect

pressing

Never

were
concealed

often
waited

The

became

in

he
looked
in

and
in

he
vainly
listened

It
was
a

for

I
have
weighed
all

calculated

These
were
the
only
obstacles
which
appeared
possible
to
the
young
man
.
He
even
thought
he
could
perceive
something
on
the
ground
at
a
distance
;
he
ventured
to
call
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
wind
wafted
back
an
almost
inarticulate
sigh
.
What
might
be
the
consequences
?
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
that
he
had
been
right
in
believing
that
the
house
was
not
illuminated
.
Another
remained
motionless
behind
some
red
curtains
which
were
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

bedroom

Almost
mad
with
grief
,

determined

venture

once

be

the
sound
of
a
voice
,
still
at
some
distance
,
but
which
was
borne
upon
the
wind
,
reached
him
.
The
moon
had
just
then
escaped
from
behind
the
cloud
which
had
concealed
it
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
come
out
upon
the
steps
,
followed
by
a
gentleman
in
black
.
``

the

chattered
.

herself
in

became
really

more
terrible

repeated

the

contracted

turned
purple

When

ventured
out
from

,
and
the
moon
shone
upon

,
which
was
so
pale
it
might
have
been
taken
for

At

he
saw

Although

should

hidden
as

he
thought
he
heard

his

told

Her

pictured
it
as

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
mad

He
pushed

entered

The

shining
through

blinds
made

appear
to
burn
paler

cast
a

over
the

A

overwhelmed

insensible

They

asked

continued
the

,
as
if
this
feeling
was
to
receive
its

,
``
is
that

struck
the

his

The

fixed

having

taken

she
went

It
was
an

Under

sat
my

I
began

She
bore

rapidly
away

Here

on

were
reflected

<PROPER_NOUN>
was

<PROPER_NOUN>
gently

the

recollected

<UNK>
its

looking

He
stood
watch
day

night
with

provided

a
lighted

in

he
had

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
-
at
the
first
signal
given
by

Sometimes
,
but
very
rarely
,
my

summoned
me
and
my

to
the
terrace
of
the
palace
;
these
were
hours

recreation

as
I

anything

the

smiling

his

Presently
he
made
such

that
I
was
paralyzed
with
fear
.
I
saw
my

tremble

murmured
my

quietly
to

Oh

I
remember

During

in

were
seated
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>

concealed
from

the

My

I
traversed
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
often
heard
-
not
from

for

from

the

he
had
read
different

the

seemed
to
acquire

expression

and
her

accent
and
the
melancholy
expression

at

charmed

horrified
him

Haidee
looked
up
abruptly
,
as
if
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

voice
had
awakened

she
resumed

<PROPER_NOUN>
repeated
from

the

`

said
she
;
`

they
bring

And
he
renewed
the

of
his

with
a

which
made

think

And
at

the

redoubled
their
cries

prayers

lamentations

And
for

stopped

overcome
by

upon

that

The

uttered

joy
and
clapped
his

entirely
filled
with

`

Oh

his

rushing
up

reached

in

They

opened

when
suddenly
my

having
looked
closely

attracting

uttered
a

cry

fell

pointing

<UNK>
by

entered

swore

at

promised
all

it

eyes
demanded

made
a
sign

carefully

the

The

was
ready

the

a

in

asked
the
count
,
seeing
him
covered
with
dust
;

The

well-known
courage
will
render
unnecessary
the
aid
of
the
police
,
whose
interference
might
seriously
affect
him
who
sends
this

He
was
on
the
point
of
sending
the
letter
to
the
commissary
of
police
,
notwithstanding
the
advice
of
his
anonymous
friend
,
or
perhaps
because
of
that
advice
,
when
suddenly
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
some
personal
enemy
,
whom
he
alone
should
recognize
and
over
whom
,
if
such
were
the
case
,
he
alone
would
gain
any
advantage

as

had
done

bowed

Having
dined
with
his
usual
tranquillity
and
moderation
,
the
count
,
making
a
signal
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
follow
him
,
went
out
by
the
<UNK>
and
on
reaching
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
,
apparently
without
design
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>

at

found
himself
opposite
his

in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
hastened
to
the
<UNK>
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
entered
hurriedly
,
and
by
the
servants
'
staircase
,
of
which
he
had
the
key
,
gained
his
bedroom
without
opening
or
<UNK>
a
single
curtain
,
without
even
the
porter
having
the
slightest
suspicion
that
the
house
,
which
he
supposed
empty
,
contained
its
chief
occupant
.
Meanwhile
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
procured
the
arms
the
count
required
-
namely
,
a
short
carbine
and
a
pair
of
double-barrelled
pistols
,
with
which
as
sure
an
aim
might
be
taken
as
with
a
<UNK>
<NUMBER>

He
had
within
his
reach
his
pistols
and
carbine
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
standing
near
him
,
held
<NUMBER>
of
the
small
Arabian
hatchets
,
whose
form
has
not
varied
since
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
The
little
light
in
the
lodge
had
long
been
extinct
.
As
the
last
stroke
died
away
,
the
count
thought
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
dressing-room
;
this
first
sound
,
or
rather
this
first
<UNK>
,
was
followed
by
a
second
,
then
a
third
;
at
the
fourth
,
the
count
knew
what
to
expect
.
However
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
only
made
a
sign
to
apprise
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
understanding
that
danger
was
approaching
from
the
other
side
,
drew
nearer
to
his
master
.
Through
the
opening
an
arm
was
passed
to
find
the
fastening
,
then
a
second
;
the
window
turned
on
its
hinges
,
and
a
man
entered
.
He
turned
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
pointed
to
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
,
facing
the
street
.
The
<UNK>
had
entered
,
and
was
feeling
his
way
,
his
arms
stretched
out
before
him
.
It
was
only
a
precaution
.
The
count
soon
heard
the
rattling
of
a
bunch
of
skeleton
keys
,
such
as
the
<UNK>
brings
when
called
to
force
a
lock
,
and
which
thieves
call
<UNK>
,
doubtless
from
the
music
of
their
nightly
song
when
they
<UNK>
against

bolt

``

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
starting
back
,
``

-
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
hatchet
.
Meanwhile
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
rapidly
taken
off
his
great-coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
shirt
,
and
one
might
distinguish
by
the
<UNK>
through
the
open
panel
that
he
wore
a

<UNK>
of
steel
mail
,
of
which
the
last

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
daggers
are
no

dreaded

was
worn
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
feared
the
dagger
at
his
breast
,
and
whose
head
was
<UNK>
with
a
hatchet
.
And
he
advanced
to
the
window
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
then
drew
a
lighted
taper
from
a
closet
,
and
when
the
thief
was
deeply
engaged
with
his
lock
,
silently
opened
the
door

taking
care

the
light
should
shine
directly
on

face

``

blocked

a

flew
back

stroking

all
bruised
by

had
held
it

scarcely

returned

glancing

from

he

his

looked

When

again
opened

the

looked
at

with

mournful
expression

himself

said
the

<UNK>
,
his

fixed
on
the

,
<UNK>
by
so
awful
a
death
.
The
police
had
orders
to
make
the
strictest
search
for
the
murderer
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
being
called
on
to
prove
the

,
was
preparing
his
brief
with
the

ardor
that
he
was
accustomed
to
exercise
when
required
to
speak
in
criminal
cases
.
It
was
agreed
that
the
<NUMBER>
millions
should
be
intrusted
to
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
to
<UNK>
;
some
persons
had
warned
the
young

of
the

of
his

father-in-law
,
who
had
of
late
sustained
repeated
losses
;
but
with
sublime
disinterestedness
and
confidence
the

refused
to
listen
,
or
to
express
a

to
the

The

demanded
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
nearly
expired

Besides
,
the
manner
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
closed
the
conference
left
a
bitter
recollection
in

<NUMBER>
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
awakened
by

who
announced

I
should

I
thought
this

After

his

overflowed

he
gave
way
to
a

But
,
on

the

the

the

fiery
nature

so
much

bowed
to

into

remained

wrapped
in

did
not
appear
to
arouse
from
his
lethargy

did
not
notice

was
entering

As

stopped
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
alighting
,
a

approached
and
gave

a

He
returned

with

in

heaving

without

he
gave

pressed
on

threw

into

from
which
everything
could
be
both
seen

For

those

were
very

An

illumined
that

like
the

before
it
disappears
behind
the

<NUMBER>
minutes
afterwards

``

returned
thus

formidable

implacable

advancing
with

crossed
on

towards

drew

He
stopped
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
and
alighted
.
They
passed
close
by
the
unhappy
being
,
who
,
concealed
behind
the
damask
curtain
,
almost
felt
<PROPER_NOUN>
dress
brush
past
him

and
his
son

warm
breath
,
pronouncing
these
words
,
-
``
Courage

He
soon
heard
the
<UNK>

the
iron
step
of
the
hackney-coach
,
then
the
coachman
's
voice
,
and
then
the
rolling

shook
the
windows

he
walked
slowly
towards

slowly

an

steps

he
had
hastened

<UNK>

almost
<UNK>
,

seized
his

led

to
her

We
may
easily
understand
how
eagerly
the

asked
for

given

received

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
read
an

when
she
knew
that
the
termination

was
as

obeyed

guided
by

had
learned
how

understand

quickly

decanter

in

The

terror

on

seemed
to
start
from

When

he
called

<UNK>
soon
returned
from

This
was
<NUMBER>

a

he

which
suited

about

He

I

seeing

could

he
dipped

upon

having

set

he

looked

<PROPER_NOUN>
did

it

concluded

How

How
could
she
extricate
herself
from
this

It
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
had
remorselessly
brought
misfortune
into

as

But
the

At

she
arose

without

she

she
left

involuntarily

at
the

descending
from

she
approached

the

Without
losing

for

,
the
concierge
took
a
whistle
from
his
pocket
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
court

and
blew
it

The
baroness
ascended
the

;
she
felt
herself
strongly
<UNK>
with
the
sadness
which
seemed
to
<UNK>
her

still
guided
by

chambre
,
who
never
lost
sight
of

for
an

,
she
was
introduced
to
the

study

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
often
heard
of
the

alluded
,
but
without
the
evidence

<UNK>
she
could
never
have
believed
that

been
carried
so
far
.
``
Then

''
``
Yes

``
Alas

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
gazed
on

stupefied
to
find

so
almost

calm
.
And
truly
this
assurance
carried
him
back
to

from
those
now
occupying
the

him
.
``
When
I

trembled
with
fear
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
started
with
joy

``

she
said

As
the
procureur
had
told
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
yet
recovered

During
the
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<UNK>
remained
tolerably
clear
,
owing
to
the
constant
presence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
caused
himself
to
be
carried
to
his
granddaughter

and
watched
her

his
paternal
tenderness

<PROPER_NOUN>
also
,
on
his
return

frequently
passed
an

<NUMBER>
with
his
father

Every
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
called
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
receive
news
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
,
extraordinary
as
it
seemed
,
each
day
found
him
less
uneasy

<PROPER_NOUN>
she
fancied
she
saw
her
stepmother
threatening
her
,
then
<PROPER_NOUN>
stretched
his
arms
towards
her
;
sometimes
mere
strangers
,
like
the
Count

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
to
visit
her
;
even
the
very
furniture
,
in
these
moments

delirium

seemed
to
move
,
and
this
state
lasted
till
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
a
deep
,
heavy
slumber
overcame
the
young
girl
,
from
which
she
did
not
awake
till
daylight
.
Meanwhile
an
unexpected
scene
was
passing
in
the
room
which
had
been
so
carefully
locked
.
Her
reason
told
her
that
all
the
visions
she
beheld
were
but
the
children

her
imagination

and
the
conviction
was
<UNK>
by

in

no

remained

nocturnal
phantoms

who
disappeared
with

coming

daylight

``
It

she
murmured

and
waited

in
the
assurance
that
this
was
but
a
dream
,
for
the
man
to
disappear
or
assume
some
other
form
.
The
pressure
she
felt
was
evidently
intended
to
arrest
her
arm
,
and
she
slowly
withdrew
it
.
Every
minute
she
had
expected
that
it
would
vanish
and
give
place
to
another
vision
;
but
the
man
,
instead
of
<UNK>
like
a
shadow
,
again
approached
her
,
and
said
in
an
agitated
voice
,
``
Now

mounted

uneasily

exclaimed

seized

with

noiselessly
closed

was
about
to
endeavor
to
do
so
again
.
When
this
terrible
chain
of
ideas
presented
itself
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
nearly
persuaded
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
call
for
help
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
raised
herself
upon
her
elbow
,
and
had
scarcely
time
to
throw
herself
down
on
the
bed
and
shade
her
eyes
with
her
arm
;
then
,
trembling
,
agitated
,
and
her
heart
beating
with
indescribable
terror
,
she
awaited
the
event
.
said
a
low
voice
.
She
saw
a
woman
in
a
white
dressing-gown
pouring
a
liquor
from
a
phial
into
her
glass
.
The
latter
recollected
the
terrible
caution
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
she
fancied
that
the
hand
not
holding
the
phial
clasped
a
long
sharp
knife
.
She
only
witnessed
the
withdrawal
of
the
arm
-
the
fair
round
arm
of
a
woman
but
<NUMBER>
years
old
,
and
who
yet
spread
death
around
her
.
The
noiseless
door
again
turned
on
its
hinges
,
and
the
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
reappeared
.
``
Alas
!
''
``
Would
you
rather
die
,
then
,
and
cause
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
death
?
''
You
will
find
it
in
the
water
you
drink
from
the
spring
,
in
the
fruit
you
pluck
from
the
tree
.
''
``
It
is
already
done
,
''
he
said
;
``
brucine
is
no
longer
employed
,
but
a
simple
narcotic
!
``
Why
?
``
How
so
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
child
!
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
you
are
an
angel
!
''
``
Do
you
recollect
in
the
arbor
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seeing
a
man
in
a
brown
cloak
,
whom
your
stepmother
was
questioning
upon
<UNK>
<UNK>
?
``
Command
me
,
sir
-
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
``
My
father
is
not
engaged
in
this
fearful
plot
,
is
he
,
sir

''
he
murmured
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
concluded
his
sentence
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
do
as
you
will
with
me
;
''
and
then
she
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
oh
,
heavens
,
what
will
befall
me
?
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
would
you
rather
denounce
your
stepmother
?
''
``
You
are
my
own
darling
child
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
Then
he
drew
from
his
<UNK>
the
little
emerald
box
,
raised
the
golden
lid
,
and
took
from
it
a
<UNK>
about
the
size
of
a
<UNK>
,
which
he
placed
in
her
hand
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
carried
the
<UNK>
to
her
mouth
,
and
swallowed
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
some
time
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
young
girl
,
who
gradually
fell
asleep
,
yielding
to
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
the
count
had
given
her
.
A
dull
and
dismal
light
was
shed
over
the
bedclothes
and
curtains
surrounding
the
young
girl
.
It
was
still
about
a
quarter
full
,
as
we
before
stated
.
At
length
she
rallied
,
drew
aside
the
curtain
,
and
leaning
over
the
pillow
gazed
intently
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
only
felt
the
pulsation
in
her
own
fingers
,
and
withdrew
her
hand
with
a
shudder
.
His
best
known
work
is
``
The
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
''
now
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Immediately
afterwards
the
light
expired
,
and
the
room
was
plunged
in
frightful
obscurity
,
while
the
clock
at
that
minute
struck
half-past
<NUMBER>
.
To
the
tender
eye
of
a
father
or
a
lover
,
the
first
glance
would
have
sufficed
to
reveal
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
condition
;
but
to
this
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
only
appeared
to
sleep
.
<UNK>
at
the
prolonged
slumber
of
the
patient
,
and
frightened
to
see
that
the
arm
was
still
hanging
out
of
the
bed
,
she
advanced
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
white
lips
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
it
being
the
hour
he
usually
visited
her
.
``
Yes
,
yes
;
let
us
hasten
up
;
it
was
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
.
''
cried
the
procureur
from
the
door
of
his
chamber
,
which
apparently
he
scarcely
dared
to
leave
.
he
exclaimed
.
he
exclaimed
,
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
.
On
the
exclamation
of
the
doctor
and
the
cry
of
the
father
,
the
servants
all
fled
with
muttered
imprecations
;
they
were
heard
running
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
long
passages
,
then
there
was
a
rush
in
the
court
,
afterwards
all
was
still
;
they
had
,
<NUMBER>
and
all
,
deserted
the
accursed
house
.
It
was
now
a
third
full
,
just
as
it
was
when
she
threw
the
contents
into
the
ashes
.
``
Ah
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
it
is
no
longer
brucine
that
is
used
;
let
me
see
what
it
is
!
''
Directly
afterwards
the
distant
sound
of
a
heavy
weight
falling
on
the
ground
was
heard
,
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
;
the
nurse
was
engaged
in
watching
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
still
absorbed
in
grief
.
``
Madame
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
ill
.
''
groaned
forth
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
,
which
was
the
more
terrible
from
the
<UNK>
of
the
sensation
in
the
iron
heart
of
that
man
.
The
<NUMBER>
men
turned
round
,
and
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
standing
at
the
door
,
pale
and
<UNK>
.
He
waited
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
and
called
for
a
servant
to
conduct
him
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
no
one
answered
,
the
servants
having
,
as
we
know
,
deserted
the
house
.
Then
he
determined
to
go
up
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
sickness
of
heart
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
pulled
the
bell
,
but
though
he
nearly
broke
the
cord
no
one
answered
.
The
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
seemed
as
though
they
would
start
from
their
sockets
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
There
was
no
occasion
to
push
the
door
,
it
was
wide
open
.
It
was
then
he
heard
a
voice
exclaim
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
dead
!
''
His
glance
,
at
first
wandering
,
fixed
itself
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Go
!
But
in
less
than
<NUMBER>
minutes
the
staircase
groaned
beneath
an
extraordinary
weight
.
But
the
most
fearful
spectacle
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
being
pushed
towards
the
bed
,
his
face
expressing
all
his
meaning
,
and
his
eyes
<UNK>
the

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
<NUMBER>
hand
leaning
on
the
back
of
the
chair

and
the

extended
towards

.
And
the
cry
issued
from
his
<UNK>
,
if
we
may
thus
speak
-
a
cry
frightful
in
its
silence
.
And
the
young
man
's
voice
was
choked
by
sobs
.
``
Tell
them
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
``
tell
them
that
I
am
her

,
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
this

turned
away
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
seeking
any
further
explanation

and
attracted
towards
him
by
the

us
towards
those

``
You

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
raising
himself
on

knee
,
his

pierced
by
a
more
acute

than
any
he
had

felt
-
``

And

taken
compassion
on

nearly
bursting
with

the

``

``
But

''
A
more
than
deathlike
silence
then
reigned
in
the
house
.
His
face
was
livid
,
large
drops
rolled
down
his
face

and
in

he
held

``

D'Avrigny
turned
round
and
uttered
a
very
feeble
``
Yes

but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
his
hand
,
rushed
to
the
bed
,
and
after
having
pressed
the

lips

with

hurriedly
left

uttering

deep

despair

<PROPER_NOUN>
retired
to
his

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
to
summon
the

''
The

doctors
,
therefore
,
entered
the
room
alone
.
``
Yes

''
answered
the
doctor
<UNK>
,
dropping
the
sheet
he
had
raised
.
The
doctor
of
the
dead
then
laid
his
permit
on
the
corner
of
the
table
,
and
having
fulfilled
his
duty
,
was
conducted
out
by
d'Avrigny
.
``
No

As
the

entered
the
street

they
saw
a

in
a
cassock
standing
on
the
threshold

<PROPER_NOUN>
recommended
the
attention
of
the

to
the
living
as
well
as

and
the

promised
to
devote
his

This
winding-sheet
was
nothing
more
than
a
beautiful
piece
of
cambric
,
which
the
young

had
bought
a
fortnight
before

They
found
him
in
the
large
arm-chair

which
served
him
for

enjoying
a
calm

nay

almost
a

The

standing
at

ushered
in

it
was
rather
a
relief

see

his

then

finding

His

She

The

as
every

<PROPER_NOUN>
for

As
for

many
remembered

amiable

so
handsome

and
so
liberal
,
that
they
chose

It

the

The

shuddered

to

Still

his

did
not

told

A

was
heard
in
the

;
the

called
his

<UNK>
with
an
energetic
``

''
``

said
the

His
features
bore
no
sign
of
that
deep
emotion
which
stops
the
beating

the
heart
and
<UNK>
the

.
The

was
a
young
man
with
light
hair
whose
face
expressed
a
<NUMBER>
times
more
emotion
than
that
which
characterized
the

The

was
depicted
in
the
most
vivid
colors
;
the
former
life
of
the

his
transformation

a

with

furnish

At

the

I

<PROPER_NOUN>
pressed
his

upon
his
brow

which
,
at

pale

had
become
red
and
burning

he
suddenly

looked

There
was

A

giddiness
overwhelmed
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
great

<UNK>
sweat
fell
from
his

upon
the
papers

held
in

The
exclamations

addressed

who
remained
perfectly
<UNK>
,
the
energetic

of

crowd
always
sure
to
rise
to
the
surface
in

any
disturbance
-
all
this
lasted
<NUMBER>
minutes
,
before
the
door-keepers

magistrates
were
able
to
restore
silence
.
A
lady
,
it
was
said

had
just
fainted
;
they

supplied
her
with
a
smelling-bottle
,
and
she
had
recovered
.
They
ask
my
name
,
I
can
not
give
it
,
since
my
parents
abandoned
me
.
All
eyes
were
turned
for
a
moment
towards
the
procureur
,
who
sat
as
motionless
as
though
a
thunderbolt
had
changed
him
into
a

I
now
repeat
that
I
was
born
at

on
the

and
that

the
son

A
shudder
ran
through
the
assembly
when
they
saw
that
the
confidence

prisoner
increased
in
proportion
to
the
terror

A

There

something
so
<UNK>
in
great
afflictions

even
in
the
worst
times
the
first
emotion
of
a
crowd
has
generally
been
to
sympathize
with
the
sufferer
in
a
great
catastrophe

There
are
some
<UNK>
which
men
understand
by
instinct

powerless
to
explain

in
such

the
greatest
poet
is
he
who
gives
utterance
to
the
most
natural
and
vehement
outburst
of
sorrow

He
made
his
way
along
the
corridors
through
force
of
habit
;
he
threw
aside
his
<UNK>
robe
,
not
out
of
deference

etiquette

but
because
it

a

he

not

He
put
out
his

to
remove
the
object
;
it
was
a
fan
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
in
the
carriage
;
this
fan
awakened
a
recollection
which
darted
through
his
mind
like
lightning

During
the
last

his

crime
had
alone
been
presented
to
his

now
another

not

terrible

suddenly
presented
itself

<PROPER_NOUN>
again
groaned
with
anguish

But
no

Yes

She

it

The

stopped
at

as

ascended
the

his

``
nothing

And
he
entered

his

extended

ran

the

paralyzed

could
he
be
,
if

had
entered
his

room

not

returned

<PROPER_NOUN>
stepped
forward
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
paces

and
beheld
his

lying

no

asleep

on

sofa

He
no

feared

phantoms

fell
from

towards

examined

He

arose

,
shaking
his

dishevelled

he

recollected

double-locked

And
the

pressed
her

in

as

on

Half

just
pulled
the

fastened

With

he
gazed

The
following
morning
they
arrived
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
the

waited
for

As
the
distance
increased
between

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
almost
superhuman
serenity
appeared
to
surround
the
count
;
he
might
have
been
taken
for

about

his

The

crowded
on

friends
taking
a
tender

sorrowful
leave
of
each

,
some
weeping

noisy
in

the

forming

gently
smiled

said

at

pointing

the
corner

exclaimed

,

the
count
smiled
,
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
when
he
did
not

to
make
any

,
and
he
again
turned
towards
the
veiled

who
soon
disappeared
at
the
corner
of
the
street
.
``

It

stood

under

,
which
forms
<NUMBER>

<UNK>
its

burnt

how

The

raised

He
proceeded

<PROPER_NOUN>

advanced

it

The

red

was

did
the

feel

gradually
fill
with
the

formerly
nearly
overwhelmed

<PROPER_NOUN>

The
journey
had
seemed
very
long
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
found

equally
short

the

The

continued
:

escaped

he
cried

There

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

After

The

was
that

left

detached

<PROPER_NOUN>
nodded

taking

began

a

while

disappeared
through

out

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
tired

<UNK>
;
he
therefore
went
to
bed

placing
his

under
his
pillow
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
reckoned
upon
the
formalities
of
the
police
and
the
idleness
of
the
<UNK>
.
As
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
hitherto
contented
himself
with
being
called
a
baron
,
he
felt
rather
flattered
at
the
title
of
excellency

and
distributed
a
dozen
silver
<UNK>
among

who
were
ready

for
<NUMBER>

,
to
call

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
interpreted
the

the
horses
galloped
off
.
``

<UNK>

-LRB-

not

,
was
the
reply
.
He
still
felt
the

<UNK>
which
he
had
experienced
the
previous
evening
,
and
which
had
procured
him
so
good
a
night
's
rest
.
Now
and
then
a
<UNK>
more
violent
than
the
rest
caused
him
to
open
his
eyes
;
then
he
felt
that
he
was
still
being
carried
with
great
rapidity
over
the
same
country
,
thickly
strewn
with
broken
<UNK>
,
which
looked
like
granite
giants
petrified
while
running
a
race
.
Danglars
fancied
that
they
had
reached
the
<UNK>
point
;
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
through
the
window
,
expecting
to
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
some
town
,
or
at
least
village
;
but
he
saw
nothing
except
what
seemed
like
a
ruin
,
where
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
men
went
and
came
like
shadows
.
The
baron
was
completely
roused
.
But
<UNK>
<UNK>
did
not
reply
.
answered
a
solemn
and
imperious
voice
,
accompanied
by
a
menacing
gesture
.
His
eyes
acquired
that
quality
which
in
the
first
moment
of
strong
emotion
enables
them
to
see
distinctly
,
and
which
afterwards
fails
from
being
too
much
<UNK>
.
he
exclaimed
.
he
asked
.
And
he
threw
himself
back
in
the
calash
,
not
this
time
to
sleep
,
but
to
think
.
``
Oh
,
unfortunate
!
''
At
length
he
saw
a
dark
mass
,
against
which
it
seemed
as
if
the
carriage
was
about
to
dash
;
but
the
vehicle
turned
to
<NUMBER>
side
,
leaving
the
barrier
behind
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
that
it
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
ramparts
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
remembered
those
interesting
stories
,
so
little
believed
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
respecting
Roman
bandits
;
he
remembered
the
adventures
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
related
when
it
was
intended
that
he
should
marry
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
On
the
left
,
in
a
sort
of
valley
,
he
perceived
a
circular
excavation
.
``
<UNK>
!
''
<NUMBER>
men
surrounded
him
,
besides
the
postilion
.
After
walking
for
about
<NUMBER>
minutes
,
during
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
exchange
a
single
word
with
his
guide
,
he
found
himself
between
a
<UNK>
and
a
clump
of
high
weeds
;
<NUMBER>
men
,
standing
silent
,
formed
a
triangle
,
of
which
he
was
the
centre
.
This
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
double
reason
to
understand
,
for
if
the
word
and
gesture
had
not
explained
the
speaker
's
meaning
,
it
was
clearly
expressed
by
the
man
walking
behind
him
,
who
pushed
him
so
rudely
that
he
struck
against
the
guide
.
There
was
no
longer
any
doubt
,
the
bankrupt
was
in
the
hands
of
Roman
banditti
.
The
path
was
wide
,
but
dark
.
A
sentinel
struck
the
rings
of
his
carbine
against
his
left
hand
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
where
is
the
captain
?
''
``
Is
this
the
man
?
''
At
this
rather
impertinent
order
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
torch
to
the
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
hastily
withdrew
that
he
might
not
have
his
<UNK>
burnt
.
From
their
beds
of
dried
leaves
or
<UNK>
at
the
back
of
the
chamber
now
arose
the
companions
of
the
man
who
had
been
found
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
reading
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
Commentaries
,
''
and
by
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
studying
the
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
Then
a
low
door
was
opened
before
him
,
and
bending
his
head
to
avoid
striking
his
forehead
he
entered
a
small
room
cut
out
of
the
rock
.
``
Oh
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
be
praised
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
is
a
real
bed
!
''
If
there
had
been
no
bolt
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
the
garrison
who
held
the
catacombs
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
encamped
round
a
master
whom
our
readers
must
have
recognized
as
the
famous
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
had
arrested
him
for
the
purpose
of
robbery
,
and
as
he
had
only
a
few
louis
about
him
,
he
doubted
not
he
would
be
ransomed
.
Therefore
,
tolerably
secure
in
being
able
to
extricate
himself
from
his
position
,
provided
he
were
not
<UNK>
at
the
unreasonable
sum
of
<NUMBER>
francs
,
he
stretched
himself
on
his
bed
,
and
after
turning
over
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
times
,
fell
asleep
with
the
tranquillity
of
the
hero
whose
life
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
studying
.
But
in
such
a
situation
a
single
moment
suffices
to
change
the
strongest
doubt
into
certainty
.
``
No
,
''
he
cried
,
``
they
have
not
wounded
,
but
perhaps
they
have
robbed
me
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
they
have
left

had

During

this

a

at

o'clock

had
been
watching

he
exclaimed
,
retreating
to
the

corner
of
his
cell
.
We
see
that

was
collected
enough
to
jest

at
the

,
as
though
to

the

the

took
some
black

from

he
began
devouring

<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
his
own
not

very
well
supplied
just
then
,
and
gradually
the
man
appeared
less
ugly
,
the
bread
less
black
,
and
the
cheese
more
fresh
,
while
those
dreadful
vulgar
onions
recalled
to
his

certain

which
his
cook
prepared
in
a
very
superior
manner
whenever

said

asked
the

<NUMBER>
hours
passed
by
and
the
giant
was
replaced
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
decidedly
an

<PROPER_NOUN>
immediately
recognized
him
as

called

``

``

in

was
about
to

said

sighed
while

carved

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
he
left
the
cell
.
What
could
be
his
intentions
towards
him
?
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
contemplated
death
with
a
mixture
of
dread
and
desire
;
the
time
had
come
when
the
implacable
spectre
,
which
exists
in
the
mind
of
every

,
arrested
his

and
called
out
with

``
Thou

They
sent
him
a

supper
,
and
took
his

.
He
who
for
so

a

had
forgotten

began
to
think
that

possible

that

might
be
discovered
by

that

and
finally
he
prayed
that
this

might
be
preserved
to

,
and
as
he
prayed
he
wept
.
He
had
picked
up
every

been

from

and
was
beginning

eat
the

covered
the

``
Are

he

fell
with

Then

``
Yes

<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
prostrate
while
the
count
withdrew
;
when
he
raised
his
head
he
saw
disappearing
down
the
passage
nothing
but
a
shadow
,
before
which
the
bandits
bowed
.
As
he
stooped
down
to
drink
,
he
saw
that
his
hair
had
become
entirely
white

A
light
yacht
,
chaste
and
elegant
in
its
form
,
was
gliding
amidst
the
first
dews
of
night
over
the
immense
lake
,
extending
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
and
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
yacht
moved
rapidly
on
,
though
there
did
not
appear
to
be
sufficient
wind
to
<UNK>
the
curls
on
the
head
of
a
young

.
``
Yes
,
your

''
said
the
captain
,
``
we
have
reached
it

''
And
then
he
again
plunged
into
a
train
of
thought
,
the
character
of
which
was
better
revealed
by
a
sad
smile
,
than
it
would
have
been
by
tears
.
The
captain
pointed
towards
the
island
,
up
the
side
of
which
ascended
a
volume
of
smoke
,
increasing
as
it
rose
.
<NUMBER>
minutes
afterwards
,
the
sails
were
<UNK>
,
and
they
cast
anchor
about
a
<NUMBER>
fathoms
from
the
little
harbor
.
``
Give
way
,
''
said
the
traveller
.
The
young
man
answered
this
invitation
with
a
gesture
of
indifference
,
and
stepped
out
of
the
boat
;
the
sea
immediately
rose
to
his
waist
.
Just
as
he
turned
,
a
hand
rested
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
voice
which
made
him
shudder
exclaimed
,
-
``
Good-evening

But

``

``

Well

let

both
examine
the

Has
the

I
love

I

I
require

on

My

I

I
waited

I
suffered

a

Oh

I
shall
sleep
calmly

<UNK>
in

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
mechanically
followed
the
count
,
and
they
had
entered
the
grotto
before
he
perceived
it
.
``
Why

down

gently
glided
into

amid

They
were
in
the
marvellous
dining-room
before
described
,
where
the

had
baskets
on
their

always
filled
with
fruits

.
``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
indescribable
tenderness
.
``
You
have
spoken
truly

according

the

death

either

violently
<UNK>
the

extended
his

``

asked
the
count
with
deep
emotion
.
The
count
fancied
that
he
was
yielding
,
and
this
belief
revived
the
horrible
doubt
that
had
overwhelmed
him
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

Then
he
said
aloud

a

gold

``

By
degrees
,
the
light

the

gradually
faded
in
the
hands
of
the
marble

held
them
,

the

appeared

He
made
a

it
fell
powerless

his

closed

through

At

his

opened

they
were
at
first
fixed

<UNK>

then
sight
returned

with

feeling

The

<PROPER_NOUN>

were

The

attracted
me
;
I
took
them
home
with
me

with
the
permission
of
the
guardian

and
devoured
them

Now
,
while
admiring
,
as
others
doubtless
will
admire
,
the
details
we
have
to
relate
,
our
main
preoccupation
concerned
a
matter
to
which
no
one
before
ourselves
had
given
a
thought
.
The
catalogue
alone
of
the
books
we
read
with
this
object
would
fill
a
whole
chapter
,
which
,
although
it
might
be
very
<UNK>
,
would
certainly
afford
our
readers
but
little
amusement
.
We
hastened
,
therefore
,
to
obtain
permission
to
print
it
,
with
the
view
of
presenting
ourselves
someday
with
the
pack
of
others
at
the
doors
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
des
<PROPER_NOUN>
et
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
if

a

by

-
in
gaining
admission
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
our
own
proper
pack
.
This
being
understood
,
let
us
proceed
with
our
history
.
There
were
nobles
,
who
made
war
against
each
other
;
there
was
the
king
,
who
made
war
against
the
cardinal
;
there
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
made
war
against
the
king
.
When
arrived
there
,
the
cause
of
the
hubbub
was
apparent
to
all
.
For
our
young
man
had
a
steed
which
was
the
observed
of
all
<UNK>
.
He
had
sighed
deeply
,
therefore
,
when
accepting
the
gift
of
the
pony
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
elder
.
At
court
,
provided
you
have
ever
the
honor
to
go
there
,

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
elder
,
''
-
an
honor
to
which
,
remember
,
your
ancient
nobility
gives
you
the
right
-
sustain
worthily
your
name
of
gentleman
,
which
has
been
worthily
borne
by
your
ancestors
for
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
years
,
both
for
your
own

and
the
sake
of
those
who
belong
to
you
.
<UNK>
<UNK>
for
a
second
perhaps
allows
the
bait
to
escape
which
during
that
exact
second
fortune
held
out
to
him
.
I
have
taught
you
how
to
handle
a
sword
;
you
have
<UNK>
of
iron
,
a
wrist
of
steel
.
Your
mother
will
add
to
them
a
recipe
for
a

balsam
,
which
she
had
from
a

which
has
the
miraculous
virtue
of
curing
all
wounds
that
do
not
reach

The
blows
which
he
received
increased
greatly
his
esteem
and
friendship
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
began
as
you
begin
.
The
adieux
were
on
this
side
longer
and
more
tender
than
they
had
been
on
the
other
-
not
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
love
his
son
,
who
was
his
only
offspring
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
man
,
and
he
would
have
considered
it
unworthy
of
a
man
to
give
way
to
his
feelings
;
whereas
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
woman
,
and
still
more
,
a
mother
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
windmills
for
giants
,
and
sheep
for
armies
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
every
smile
for
an
insult
,
and
every
look
as
a
provocation
-
whence
it
resulted
that
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
his
fist
was
constantly
doubled
,
or
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
;
and
yet
the
fist
did
not
descend
upon
any
<UNK>
,
nor
did
the
sword
issue
from
its
scabbard
.
D'Artagnan
fancied
quite
naturally
,
according
to
his
custom
,
that
he
must
be
the
object
of
their
conversation
,
and
listened
.
Nevertheless
,
D'Artagnan
was
desirous
of
examining
the
appearance
of
this
impertinent
personage
who
<UNK>
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
all
these
remarks
with
the
rapidity
of
a
most
minute
observer
,
and
doubtless
from
an
instinctive
feeling
that
this
stranger
was
destined
to
have
a
great
influence
over
his
future
life
.
Unfortunately
,
as
he
advanced
,
his
anger
increased
at
every
step
;
and
instead
of
the
proper
and
lofty
speech
he
had
prepared
as
a
prelude
to
his
challenge
,
he
found
nothing
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
a
gross
<UNK>
,
which
he
accompanied
with
a
furious
gesture
.
replied
the
young
man
,
<UNK>
exasperated
with
this
mixture
of
insolence
and
good
manners
,
of
politeness
and
scorn
.
``
This
horse
is
decidedly
,
or
rather
has
been
in
his
youth
,
a
<UNK>
,
''
resumed
the
stranger
,
continuing
the
remarks
he
had
begun
,
and
addressing
himself
to
his
auditors
at
the
window
,
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
however
placed
himself
between
him
and
them
.
``
And
I
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
will
allow
no
man
to
laugh
when
it
<UNK>
me
!
''
He
drew
his
sword
entirely
from
the
scabbard
,
and
followed
him
,
crying
,
``
<UNK>
,
turn
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
lest
I
strike
you
behind
!
''
Then
,
in
a
suppressed
tone
,
as
if
speaking
to
himself
,
``
This
is
annoying
,
''
continued
he
.
But
at
the
same
moment
,
his
<NUMBER>
auditors
,
accompanied
by
the
host
,
fell
upon
D'Artagnan
with
sticks
,
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
the
best
face
possible
,
and
never
retreating
<NUMBER>
step
before
his
<NUMBER>
assailants
,
who
continued
to
shower
blows
upon
him
.
Keep
up
the
dance
,
then
,
since
he
will
have
it
so
.
Another
blow
full
upon
his
forehead
at
the
same
moment
brought
him
to
the
ground
,
covered
with
blood
and
almost
fainting
.
``
Well
,
how
is
it
with
this
madman
?
''
``
Oh
,
yes
!
said
the
gentleman
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
your
Excellency
,
he
is
not
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
replied
the
host
,
with
a
<UNK>
of
contempt
;
``
for
during
his
fainting
we
rummaged
his
valise
and
found
nothing
but
a
clean
shirt
and
eleven
crowns
-
which
however
,
did
not
prevent
his
saying
,
as
he
was
fainting
,
that
if
such
a
thing
had
happened
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
you
should
have
cause
to
repent
of
it
at
a
later
period
.
''
``
Yes
;
he
struck
his
pocket
and
said
,
`
We
shall
see
what
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
will
think
of
this
insult
offered
to
his
protege

'
''
What
was
there
in
it
?
''
The
host
,
who
was
not
endowed
with
great
perspicacity
,
did
not
observe
the
expression
which
his
words
had
given
to
the
physiognomy
of
the
stranger
.
``
Can
Treville
have
set
this
<PROPER_NOUN>
upon
me
?
In
conscience
,
I
can
not
kill
him

and
yet
,

added
he
,
with
a
coldly
menacing
expression
,
``
he
annoys
me

Has
he
taken
off

Go
;
make
out
my

``
It

``
Can
he
be
afraid
of

''
I
had
better
get
on
horseback
,
and
go
and
meet
her
.
And
the
stranger
,
muttering
to
himself
,
directed
his
steps
toward
the
kitchen
.
''
His
interlocutor
,
whose
head
appeared
through
the
carriage
window
,
was
a
woman
of
from
<NUMBER>
to
two-and-twenty
years
.
She
was
talking
with
great
animation
with
the
stranger
.
asked
the
fair
traveler
.
``
What
,
without
<UNK>
this
insolent
boy
?
''
``
Will
not

him

''
``
You
are
right

''
cried
the
gentleman
;
``
begone
then
,
on
your
part
,
and
I
will
depart
as
quickly
on
mine
.
''
cried
the
stranger
to
his
servant
,
without
checking
the
speed
of
his
horse
;
and
the
man
,
after
throwing
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
silver
pieces
at
the
foot
of
mine
host
,
galloped
after
his
master
.
But
his
wound
had
rendered
him
too
weak
to
support
such
an
exertion
.
``
He
is
a
coward
,
indeed
,
''
grumbled
the
host
,
drawing
near
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
endeavoring
by
this
little
flattery
to
make
up
matters
with
the
young
man
,
as
the
<UNK>
of
the
fable
did
with
the
<UNK>
he
had
despised
the
evening
before
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
faltered
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
fainted
a
second
time
.
The
host
had
reckoned
upon
eleven
days
of
confinement
at
a
crown
a
day
,
but
he
had
reckoned
without
his
guest
.
``
My
letter
of
recommendation
!
''
<UNK>
,
it
resulted
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
proceeded
to
draw
his
sword
in
earnest
,
he
found
himself
purely
and
simply
armed
with
a
<UNK>
of
a
sword
about
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
inches
in
length
,
which
the
host
had
carefully
placed
in
the
scabbard
.
``
Yes
,
where
is
this
letter
?
''
After
the
king
and
the
cardinal
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
man
whose
name
was
perhaps
most
frequently
repeated
by
the
military
,
and
even
by
citizens
.
demanded
the
host
,
after
a
few
minutes
of
useless
investigation
.
``
It
contained
my
fortune
!
''
``
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
I
would
rather
have
lost
a
<NUMBER>
pistoles
than
have
lost
it
.
''
cried
he
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
He
remained
there
some
time
alone
.
The
fact
was
that
none
of
his
servants
,
none
of
the
travelers
present
,
could
have
gained
anything
by
being
possessed
of
this
paper
.
``
Then
that
's
my
thief
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
foot
,
carrying
his
little
packet
under
his
arm
,
and
walked
about
till
he
found
an
apartment
to
be
let
on
terms
suited
to
the
<UNK>
of
his
means
.
After
this
,
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
he
had
conducted
himself
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without
remorse
for
the
past
,
confident
in
the
present
,
and
full
of
hope
for
the
future
,
he
retired
to
bed
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
brave
.
He
was
the
friend
of
the
king
,
who
honored
highly
,
as
everyone
knows
,
the
memory
of
his
father
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
a
real
liking
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
a
royal
liking
,
a
<UNK>
liking
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
a
liking
.
His
was
<NUMBER>
of
those
rare
<UNK>
,
endowed
with
an
obedient
intelligence
like
that
of
the
dog
;
with
a
blind
valor
,
a
quick
eye
,
and
a
prompt
hand
;
to
whom
sight
appeared
only
to
be
given
to
see
if
the
king
were
dissatisfied
with
anyone
,
and
the
hand
to
strike
this
displeasing
personage
,
whether
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
or
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
When
he
saw
the
formidable
and
chosen
body
with
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
surrounded
himself
,
this
second
,
or
rather
this
first
king
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
became
desirous
that
he
,
too
,
should
have
his
guard
.
While
exclaiming
loudly
against
duels
and
<UNK>
,
they
excited
them
secretly
to
quarrel
,
<UNK>
an
<UNK>
satisfaction
or
genuine
regret
from
the
success
or
defeat
of
their
own
combatants
.
Treville
understood
admirably
the
war
method
of
that
period
,
in
which
he
who
could
not
live
at
the
expense
of
the
enemy
must
live
at
the
expense
of
his
compatriots
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
employed
this
powerful
weapon
for
the
king
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
the
friends
of
the
king
-
and
then
for
himself
and
his
own
friends
.
Still
further
,
in
spite
of
sword
thrusts
which
<UNK>
,
and
painful
exercises
which
fatigue
,
he
had
become
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
gallant
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
insinuating
lady
's
men
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
softest
<UNK>
of
interesting
nothings
of
his
day
;
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
talked
of
as
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
talked
of
<NUMBER>
years
before
,
and
that
was
not
saying
a
little
.
Among
these
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
sought
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
descended
the
office
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
ran
after
any
sort
of
favor
-
gentlemen
from
the
provinces
anxious
to
be
<UNK>
,
and
servants
in
all
sorts
of
liveries
,
bringing
and
carrying
<UNK>
between
their
masters
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
is
true
that
this
provincial
was
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
that
,
particularly
at
this
period
,
the
compatriots
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
the
reputation
of
not
being
easily
intimidated
.
When
he
had
passed
<NUMBER>
group
he
began
to
breathe
more
freely
;
but
he
could
not
help
observing
that
they
turned
round
to
look
at
him
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
D'Artagnan
,
who
had
till
that
day
entertained
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
,
felt
ridiculous
.
These
<NUMBER>
others
fenced
against
him
with
their
agile
swords
.
The
conditions
required
that
at
every
hit
the
man
touched
should
quit
the
game
,
yielding
his
turn
for
the
benefit
of
the
adversary
who
had
hit
him
.
On
the
landing
they
were
no
longer
fighting
,
but
amused
themselves
with
stories
about
women
,
and
in
the
antechamber
,
with
stories
about
the
court
.
There
,
to
his
great
astonishment
,
D'Artagnan
heard
the
policy
which
made
all
<PROPER_NOUN>
tremble
<UNK>
aloud
and
openly
,
as
well
as
the
private
life
of
the
cardinal
,
which
so
many
great
nobles
had
been
punished
for
trying
to
<UNK>
into
.
They
looked
hesitatingly
around
them
,
and
appeared
to
doubt
the
thickness
of
the
partition
between
them
and
the
office
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
a
fresh
allusion
soon
brought
back
the
conversation
to
his
Eminence
,
and
then
the
laughter
recovered
its
<UNK>
and
the
light
was
not
withheld
from
any
of
his
actions
.
Although
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
court
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
courtiers
,
and
this
his
first
appearance
in
that
place
,
he
was
at
length
noticed
,
and
somebody
came
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
.
He
did
not
wear
the
uniform
cloak
-
which
was
not
<UNK>
at
that
epoch
of
less
liberty
but
more
independence
-
but
a
<UNK>
doublet
,
a
little
faded
and
worn
,
and
over
this
a
magnificent
baldric
,
worked
in
gold
,
which
shone
like
water
<UNK>
in
the
sun
.
``
What
would
you
have
?
''
Besides
,
<NUMBER>
must
lay
out
one
's
inheritance
somehow
.
''
``
No
,
upon
honor
and
by
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
,
I
bought
it
with
the
contents
of
my

purse
,
''
answered
he
whom
they
designated
by
the
name
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Is
it
not
true
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
His
delicate
mustache
marked
a
perfectly
straight
line
upon
his
upper
lip
;
he
appeared
to
dread
to
lower
his
hands
lest
their
veins
should
swell
,
and
he
<UNK>
the
tips
of
his
ears
from
time
to
time
to
preserve
their
delicate
pink
<UNK>
.
They
continued
to
admire
it
,
but
said
no
more
about
it
;
and
with
a
rapid
change
of
thought
,
the
conversation
passed
suddenly
to
another
subject
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
<UNK>
tone
.
``
I
had
it

the

``

with

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

after

``

Scarcely
had

descended

down

stairs

at
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
stopped
short

``
Ah

``
Near
the

''
That
will
do

And
he
set
off
running
as

the

possessed
him
,
hoping

find
the

,
whose

not

.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
reckoned
without

He
was
particularly
anxious

avoid
<UNK>
the
freshness
of
the
magnificent
baldric
we
are
acquainted

;
but
on
timidly
opening
his

he
found

fixed

``

``

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
piqued
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
with
rage
,
and
made
a
movement
to
rush
after

But
neither
in
the
street
he
had
passed
through
,
nor
in
the

which
his

pervaded
,
could
he
see
anyone
;
however
slowly
the

had
walked

he
was
gone
on
his

,
or
perhaps
had
entered
some
house
.
It
was
scarcely
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
yet
this

had
already
brought
him
into
disgrace
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
could
not
fail

the

As

is
the

extinguished

he
finished

even

with
terrible

in
both

in
case

he
made

upon

conduct
:
``

No

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

D'Artagnan
did

walked

<PROPER_NOUN>
scolded

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastened

arose

putting

By

o'clock

he

The

<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
were
already

were
playing
together

Now
,
as
upon
this
audience

in

<PROPER_NOUN>
imagination

depended
his

he
saluted
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
politely

declaring
that

not
resume

should
be

went
and
took
his

near
the
cord
and
in
the
gallery
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

resumed
the

,
twisting
his
mustache
,
``
look
at

as

``
Well

tranquilly

said
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
astonished
that
his

had
not
produced
more

upon
the

.
As
D'Artagnan
had
no
time
to
lose
,
on
account
of
the
audience
of
the
king
,
which
was
fixed
for
midday
,
he
cast
his

around
,
and
seeing
that
the
street
was
empty
,
said
to
his

,
``
My
faith

But
,
''
said
he
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
thus
provoked

In
an

his

glittered
in
his

he
sprang
upon

whom
,
thanks
to
his

he
hoped

He
freed
his

made

touched

on
the
shoulder

<PROPER_NOUN>
now
fell
,
and
as
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
only
<NUMBER>
against
<NUMBER>
,
they
began
to
cry
,
``

the

<PROPER_NOUN>

often
took
part

<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
in
these
quarrels

The
<UNK>
became
general
,
but
strength
was
on
the
side
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
The
proposition
had
been
made
,
and
received
with
enthusiasm
,
when
fortunately
eleven
o'clock
struck
.
``
Quick
to
the

said
he
,
``
to
the

``
Had

asked
he
,
``
any
intention

holding
this
hunting
party
yesterday

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

This
advice
was
too
reasonable
,
and
moreover
came
from
a
man
who
knew
the
king
too
well
,
to
allow
the
<NUMBER>
young
men
to
dispute
it
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
already
prejudiced
by
his
esquire

whose
relative
,

already
know

<PROPER_NOUN>
was

replied
that
it
was
neither

on

for
him

whose
people

had
<UNK>
and
whose
hotel
they
had
endeavored
to
burn
.
The
<NUMBER>
nobles
saluted
each

politely
,
for
if
no
friendship
existed
between
them
,
there
was
at
least
esteem
.
``
I
have
no

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

I
warn
you

``
How

<PROPER_NOUN>

your

``

<UNK>
him
,
in
the
name

the
<PROPER_NOUN>

whom
he
must
perhaps
appear

to
speak
the
truth

The
latter
,
on
seeing
these
<NUMBER>
noble
lords
who
came
to
visit
him
,
endeavored
to
raise
himself
up
in
his
bed
;
but
he
was
too
weak
,
and
exhausted
by
the
effort
,
he
fell
back
again
almost
senseless
.
Placed
between
life
and
death
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
,
he
had
no
idea
for
a
moment
of
concealing
the
truth
;
and
he
described
to
the
<NUMBER>
nobles
the
affair
exactly
as
it
had
passed
.
It
may
easily
be
understood
,
therefore
,
that
the
conversation
during
the
whole
of
dinner
turned
upon
the
<NUMBER>
checks
that
his
Eminence

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
received
.
Our

had
been
waiting
about
half
an
hour
,
amid
a
crowd
of
courtiers
,
when
all
the
doors
were
thrown
open
,
and
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
announced
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
,
walking
fast

In
royal
<UNK>
it
is
worth
more
to
be
viewed
with
an
angry
eye
than
not
to
be
seen
at
all
.
``
<UNK>
go

badly

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
;
``
and
we
shall
not
be
made

''
This
,
however
,
did
not
prevent
his
asking

with
the

coolness
,
after
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
health
.
``
How

Upon

everything

the

said
the
king

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
understood
that
it
was
to

this

was
addressed
,
approached
,
assuming
a

air

<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
related
the

of

in

how
,
not
having
been
able
to
sleep
for
the

he
felt
in
the

seeing
his
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
had
gone
to
his
<NUMBER>
friends
<NUMBER>
hours
before
the
hour
of
audience
;
how
they
had
gone
together
to
the
tennis
court
,
and
how
,
upon
the
fear
he
had
manifested
lest
he
receive
a
ball
in

face
,
he
had
been
<UNK>
at
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
had
nearly
paid
for
his
<UNK>
with
his
life
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
nothing
to
do
with

matter
,
with
the
loss
of
his
hotel
.
But
that
's
quite
enough
,
gentlemen
;
please
to
understand

that
's
enough

``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
a
proof
of
my
satisfaction
.
''
``
There

''
said
the
king
,
looking
at
a
clock
,
``
there
,
now

past

cried
the

companions
,
with
<NUMBER>
voice
,
``
we
would
allow

to
pieces
in

''
I
enjoy
beforehand
the
face
the
cardinal
will
make
.
The
cardinal
,
as
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
said
,
was
really
furious
,
so
furious
that
during
<NUMBER>
days
he
<UNK>
himself
from
the
king
's
gaming
table
.
The
repast
had
been
ordered
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
lackey
furnished
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Nevertheless
,
when
he
waited
at
the
dinner
given
my
his
master
,
and
saw
him
take
out
a
handful
of
gold
to
pay
for
it
,
he
believed
his
fortune
made
,
and
returned
thanks
to
heaven
for
having
thrown
him
into
the
service
of
such
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
his
part
,
had
a
valet
whom
he
had
trained
in
his
service
in
a
thoroughly
peculiar
fashion
,
and
who
was
named
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
words
were
brief
and
expressive
,
conveying
all
that
was
meant
,
and
no
more
;
no
<UNK>
,
no
embroidery
,
no
arabesques
.
He
certainly
did
not
prevent
others
from
speaking
of
them
before
him
,
although
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
this
kind
of
conversation
,
in
which
he
only
mingled
by
bitter
words
and
<UNK>
remarks
,
was
very
disagreeable
to
him
.
Sometimes
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
feared
his
master
as
he
did
fire
,
while
entertaining
a
strong
attachment
to
his
person
and
a
great
veneration
for
his
talents
,
believed
he
perfectly
understood
what
he
wanted
,
flew
to
execute
the
order
received
,
and
did
precisely
the
contrary
.
He
not
only
talked
much
,
but
he
talked
loudly
,
little
caring
,
we
must
render
him
that
justice
,
whether
anybody
listened
to
him
or
not
.
But
with
his
simple
Musketeer
's
uniform
and
nothing
but
the
manner
in
which
he
threw
back
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
instantly
took
the
place
which
was
his
due
and
consigned
the
ostentatious
Porthos
to
the
second
rank
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
pacific
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
his
master
had
changed
into
the
infinitely
more
sonorous
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
of
whom
we
believe
we
have
sufficiently
explained
the
character
-
a
character
which
,
like
that
of
his
lackey
was
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
now
that
we
are
acquainted
,
<UNK>
at
least
,
with
the
masters
and
the
valets
,
let
us
pass
on
to
the
<UNK>
occupied
by
each
of
them
.
It
had
long
been
an
object
of
ambition
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
addition
to
the
sword
,
there
was
a
portrait
representing
a
nobleman
of
the
time
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
dressed
with
the
greatest
elegance
,
and
who
wore
the
Order
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
Ghost
;
and
this
portrait
had
certain
<UNK>
of
lines
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
certain
family
likenesses
which
indicated
that
this
great
noble
,
a
knight
of
the
Order
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
his
ancestor
.
Every
time
he
passed
with
a
friend
before
his
windows
,
at
<NUMBER>
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
sure
to
be
placed
in
full
livery
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
head
and
his
hand
,
and
said
,
``
That
is
my
abode
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
by
nature
very
curious
-
as
people
generally
are
who
possess
the
genius
of
intrigue
-
did
all
he
could
to
make
out
who
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
really
were
-LRB-
for
under
these
<UNK>

concealed
his
family
name
-RRB-
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
particular
,
who
,
a
league
away
,
<UNK>
of
nobility
.
What
could
this
treachery
be
?
The
only
thing
to
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
would
have
been
belief
in
all
the
good
things
he
said
of
himself
.
I
spoke
of
them
because
<PROPER_NOUN>
talked
of
them
himself
,
because
he
had
paraded
all
these
fine
things
before
me
.
The
handkerchief
you
saw
had
not
been
given
to
me
,
but
it
had
been
forgotten
and
left
at
my
house
by
<NUMBER>
of
my
friends
.
You
are
not
a
priest
,
you
are
a
Musketeer
!
''
``
Not
at
all
;
it
interests
me
very
much
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
and
at
this
moment
I
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
held
out
his
hand
in
a
cordial
manner
to
his
young
companion
,
and
took
leave
of
him
.
As
to
the
rest
,
the
life
of
the
<NUMBER>
young
friends
was
joyous
enough
.
On
the
days
when
he
won
he
was
insolent
and
ostentatious
;
if
he
lost
,
he
disappeared
completely
for
several
days
,
after
which
he
reappeared
with
a
pale
face
and
<UNK>
person
,
but
with
money
in
his
purse
.
Sometimes
in
the
midst
of
dinner
,
when
everyone
,
under
the
attraction
of
wine
and
in
the
warmth
of
conversation
,
believed
they
had
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
hours
longer
to
enjoy
themselves
at
table
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
his
watch
,
arose
with
a
<UNK>
smile
,
and
took
leave
of
the
company
,
to
go
,
as
he
said
,
to
consult
a
<UNK>
with
whom
he
had
an
appointment
.
He
received
<NUMBER>
sous
per
day
,
and
for
a
month
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
gay
as
a
<UNK>
,
and
affable
toward
his
master
.
``
This
is
serious
,
''
answered
the
<NUMBER>
friends
;
``
it
is
a
family
affair
.
After
having
well
beaten
him
,
he
forbade
him
to
leave
his
service
without
his
permission
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
equally
seized
with
admiration
,
and
said
no
more
about
going
away
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
although
he
was
not
a
Musketeer
,
performed
the
duty
of
<NUMBER>
with
remarkable
punctuality
.
On
their
side
,
the
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
were
much
attached
to
their
young
comrade
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
sigh
,
donned
his
uniform
,
which
he
would
have
exchanged
for
that
of
a
Musketeer
at
the
expense
of
<NUMBER>
years
of
his
existence
.
The
company
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
le
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
thus
received
<NUMBER>
instead
of
<NUMBER>
when
it
admitted
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
last
it
became
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
turn
,
who
performed
it
with
a
good
grace
and
who
succeeded
-
as
he
said
,
by
selling
some
theological
books
-
in
procuring
a
few
pistoles
.
Then
the
inconvenience
became
distress
.
He
was
a
man
,
as
must
have
been
already
perceived
,
who
made
but
little
noise
,
and
yet
was
much
sought
after
.
He
fancied
himself
a
burden
to
the
society
,
forgetting
in
his
perfectly
juvenile
good
faith
that
he
had
fed
this
society
for
a
month
;
and
he
set
his
mind
<UNK>
to
work
.
He
was
thinking

even
seriously
<UNK>
his
brain

<NUMBER>

tapped
gently
at

<NUMBER>
hours

had
asked

D'Artagnan
dismissed

requested

The

thought

declared

<PROPER_NOUN>
for
<NUMBER>

discovered

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making

concealed
himself
in

near

stone
bench
placed
at
the
back

niche
.
``
This

The

in

was
opened

D'Artagnan
then
saw
that

took
from

pocket
a

which
she
unfolded
quickly

which
took

Placed
where

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not

<PROPER_NOUN>

however

could
only
see
enough

recognize
the

not
enough

distinguish

The

who
was
outside

turned
round

passed
within

pulling
down

This
method
was
so
simple

D'Artagnan
employed
it
quite
naturally

instinctively

He
came
up
with
her
before
she
had
traversed
a
third

the
street

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the

This
personage
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
respectable
martyr
of
the
political
and
amorous
intrigues
which
<UNK>
themselves
so
nicely
together
at
this
gallant
and
chivalric
period
.
The
officers
perceived
that
they
had
not
to
deal
with
a
gentleman
,
and
they
treated
him
like
a
very
peasant
.
The
commissary
was
seated
in
the
chair
,
and
was
writing
at
the
table
.
His
head
,
supported
by
a
long
and
flexible
neck
,
issued
from
his
large
black
robe
,
balancing
itself
with
a
motion
very
much
like
that
of
the
<UNK>
thrusting
his
head
out
of
his
shell
.
He
complicated
this
exordium
by
an

painted
the

deeds

with

The
love
with
which
his
young
wife
had
inspired
him
was
a
secondary
sentiment
,
and
was
not
strong
enough
to
contend
with
the
<UNK>
feelings
we
have
just
<UNK>

asked
the
commissary
,
with
an
air
of
doubt
.
``
Of
high
treason
!
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
the
commissary
,
looking
at
the

his

had
the
faculty
of
reading
to
the

hearts

``
Whom

The

now
appeared
to
experience
a
little
uneasiness
.
The
face
of

grew
still
darker
.
``
That

made
a

in

put

opened
quickly

a

introduced
by

of

They
locked

The
carriage
,
however
,
passed
on
.
He
wished
to
confess
to
the
officer
,
and
upon
his
refusal
,
uttered
such
pitiable
cries
that
the
officer
told
him
that
if
he
continued
to
<UNK>
him
thus
,
he
should
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
.
There
remained
,
then
,
no
other
place
to
fear
but
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<UNK>
;
the
carriage
was
taking
the
direct
road
to
it

When
he
was
within
<NUMBER>
paces
of
it
,
he
heard
a
noise
of
people
and
the
carriage
stopped
.
The
door
opened
;
<NUMBER>
guards
received
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
their
arms
from
the

who
supported
him
.
His
ears
had
perceived
sounds
without
comprehending
them
;
he
might
have
been
executed
at
that
moment
without
his
making
a
single
gesture
in
his

defense
or
uttering
a

to
implore
mercy

At

,
with

he
lifted

from

found
himself
on

``

''
stammered
the
mercer
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
``

your

''
It
was
a
large
cabinet
,
close
and
stifling
,
with
the
walls
furnished
with
arms
offensive
and
defensive
,
and
in
which
there
was
already
a
fire
,
although
it
was
scarcely
the
end
of
the

of

This
man
,
except
a
sword
,
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
soldier
;
and
his
buff
boots
still
slightly
covered
with
dust
,
indicated
that
he
had
been
on
horseback
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
``

At

reading
and

of
examination
,
the
cardinal
was
satisfied

The

repressed
a

the

sprang
out

all

displayed
in
obeying

,
which
did
not
prove
want
of
sagacity
,
became
chancellor
,
served
his
Eminence
with
zeal
in
his
hatred
against
the
queen
-
mother
and
his
vengeance
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
the
judges
in
the
affair
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

encouraged
the
attempts

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
chief
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
then
,
at
length
,
invested
with
the
entire
confidence
of
the
cardinal
-
a
confidence
which
he
had
so
well
<UNK>
received
the
singular
commission
for
the
execution
of
which
he
presented
himself
in
the
queen
's
apartments
.
Truly
,
this
is
an
<UNK>
!

I
am
a
criminal
,
as
it
appears

The
chancellor
advanced
,
therefore
,
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
said
with
a
very
perplexed
and
embarrassed
air
,
``
And
now
it
remains
for
me
to
make
the
principal
examination
.

This

in

;
and
yet
this
letter
must
be
somewhere
.
''
``
Well
,
it
is
true
!
''
And
the
queen
laid
her
beautiful
hand
on
her
bosom
.
But
I
repeat
to
you
,
I
am
charged
with
<UNK>
it
;
and
if
you
do
not
give
it
up
-
''
``
Well

''
``
That
my

go
far

madame

on

''
``
The

<UNK>
violent
!
No
,
no

would
rather

''
The
queen
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
great
beauty
.
``
There
,
monsieur
,
there
is
that
letter
!
''
The
chancellor
carried
the
letter
to
the
king
without
having
read
a
single
word
of
it
.
The
king
,
quite
delighted
,
inquired
if
the
cardinal
was
still
at
the
Louvre
;
he
was
told
that
his
Eminence
awaited
the
orders
of
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
business
cabinet
.
The
cardinal
took
the
letter
,
and
read
it
with
the
greatest
attention
;
then
,
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
it
,
he
read
it
a
second
time
.
``
I
say
,
sire
,
that
my
health
is
sinking
under
these
excessive
struggles
and
these

labors

Be
satisfied
,
all
who
are
named
in

shall
be
punished
as
they
deserve
,
even
the
queen
herself

''
Oh
,
if
she
betrayed
your

it
would
be
quite
another

,
and
I
should
be
the
first
to
say
,
`
No

sire

no
grace
for
the

And
even
if
she
were
to
be
seriously
offended
,
I
could
well
understand
it
;
your
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
treated
her
with
a
severity
-
''
``
It
is
thus
I
will
always
treat
my

whatever

incur
in
acting
severely
toward

.
''
``
On
the
contrary
,
sire
,
set
the
example

said
the
king
.
``
By
doing
a
thing
which
you
know
will
be
agreeable
to
her
.
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

you
know
that
I

not
like

''
<UNK>

a
royal
virtue
;
employ
it
,
and
you
will
find
that
you
derive
advantage
therein
.
''
Her
<UNK>
pride
and
her
<UNK>
dignity
had
both
been
so
cruelly
offended
that
she
could
not
come
round
at
the
first
advance
;
but
,
<UNK>
by
the
advice
of
her
women
,
she
at
last
had
the
appearance
of
beginning
to
forget
.
Indeed
,
every
day
the
king
asked
the
cardinal
when
this
fete
should
take
place
;
and
every
day
the
cardinal
,
under
some
pretext
,
deferred
fixing
it
.
On
the
same
day
the
cardinal
received
this
letter
the
king
put
his
customary
question
to
him
.
``
Well
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
have
you
made
your

That
will
fall
in
wonderfully
well
;
you
will
not
appear
to
have
gone
out
of
your
way
to
please
the
queen
.
''
More
than
once
the
king
had
been
humiliated
by
the
cardinal
,
whose
police
,
without
having
yet
attained
the
perfection
of
the
modern
police
,
were
excellent
,
being
better
informed
than
himself
,
even
upon
what
was
going
on
in
his
own
household
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
wanted
a
discussion
from
which
some
light
or
other
might
break
,
convinced
as
he
was
that
the
cardinal
had
some
<UNK>
and
was
preparing
for
him
<NUMBER>
of
those
terrible
surprises
which
his
Eminence
was
so
skillful
in
getting
up
.
Let
me
know
what
crime
I
have
committed
.
I
wish
,
in
order
to
honor
our
worthy
aldermen
,
you
should
appear
in
ceremonial
costume
,
and
above
all
,
ornamented
with
the
diamond
studs
which
I
gave
you
on
your
<UNK>
.
She
became
excessively
pale
,
leaned
her
beautiful
hand
upon
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
hand
appeared
then
like
<NUMBER>
of
wax
,
and
looking
at
the
king
with
terror
in
her
eyes
,
she
was
unable
to
reply
by
a
single
syllable
.
``
You
will
appear
at
this
ball
?
''
The
queen
's
paleness
,
if
possible
,
increased
;
the
king
perceived
it
,
and
enjoyed
it
with
that
cold
cruelty
which
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
worst
sides
of
his
character
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
instinctively
that
he
ought
not
to
reply
to
this
question
,
the
queen
having
put
it
in
an
almost
dying
voice
.
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
astonished
king
;
``
but
why
do
you
ask
that
?
''
Is
there
any
crime
in
this
request
?
''
``
That
is
well
,
''
said
the
king
,
retiring
,
``
that
is
well
;
I
count
upon
it
.
''
-
for
the
cardinal
knows
all
,
and
it
is
he
who
urges
on
the
king
,
who
as
yet
knows
nothing
but
will
soon
know
everything
.
In
fact
,
her
position
was
terrible
.
Thus
,
while
contemplating
the
misfortune
which
threatened
her
and
the
abandonment
in
which
she
was
left
,
she
broke
out
into
sobs
and
tears
.
In
fact
,
at
<NUMBER>
of
the
doors
which
opened
into
the
queen
's
apartment
appeared
the
pretty

said
the
young
woman
,
clasping
her
hands
and
weeping
herself
at
the
queen
's
sorrows
;
``
I
am

``
Yes

the
queen
;

The
queen
ran
to
a
little
table
,
on
which
were
ink
,
paper
,
and
pens
.
``
Money

<NUMBER>

afterward
she
was
at
home
.
The

mercer
had
,
immediately
upon
<UNK>
his
house
,
informed
his

of
his
happy
return

and
his

had
replied
by
congratulating

telling
him
that
the

she
could
steal

should
be
devoted

The

fancied

already
on

Besides

he
wore

did
as

preceded

The

remained

short
time
to
receive
the
compliments
of
the
city
<UNK>
and
to
reply
to
the
salutations
of
the
ladies

He
went
straight
to
the
queen
,
and
in
an
altered
voice
said
,
``
Why

madame

have
you
not
thought
proper

know

If

made

that

``
Sire

the

,
``

There
was
a
moment
of
trouble
and
confusion
in
the
assembly
.
He
was
in
a
most
elegant
hunting
costume
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
other
nobles
were
dressed
like
him
.
The
king
opened
it
,
and
found
in
it
<NUMBER>
diamond
studs
.
The
king
looked
at
the
cardinal
as
if
to
interrogate
him
;
but
he
had
not
time
to
address
any
question
to
him
-
a
cry
of
admiration
burst
from
every
mouth
.
On
her
left
shoulder
sparkled
the
diamonds
studs
,
on
a
bow
of
the
same
color
as
the
plumes
and
the
<UNK>
.
At
that
moment
the
violins
sounded
the
signal
for
the
ballet
.
A
cold
sweat
covered
the
brow
of
the
cardinal
.
With
these
words
he
held
out
to
the
queen
the
<NUMBER>
studs
the
cardinal
had
given
him
.
The
king
called
the
cardinal
.
``
And
I
an
the
more
grateful
to
your
Eminence
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
smile
that
proved
she
was
not
the
dupe
of
this
ingenious
gallantry
,
``
from
being
certain
that
these
<NUMBER>
studs
alone
have
cost
you
as
much
as
all
the
others
cost
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
He
turned
and
saw
a
young
woman
,
who
made
him
a
sign
to
follow
her
.
D'Artagnan
therefore
followed
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
moved
by
a
double
sentiment
-
love
and
curiosity
.
The
opening
of
this
door
disclosed
a
brilliant
light
,
and
she
disappeared
.
The
queen
attributed
this
joyous
feeling
to
the
beauty
of
the
fete
,
to
the
pleasure
she
had
experienced
in
the
ballet
;
and
as
it
is
not
permissible
to
contradict
a
queen
,
whether
she
smile
or
weep
,
everybody
<UNK>
on
the
gallantry
of
the
aldermen
of
the
city
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
D'Artagnan
at
once
comprehended
that
this
was
his
recompense
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
the
ring
on
his
finger
,
and
again
waited
;
it
was
evident
that
all
was
not
yet
over
.
The
sound
of
voices
diminished
by
degrees
in
the
adjoining
chamber
.
``
Silence
!
''
``
A
note
which
you
will
find
at
home
will
tell
you

<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
home
immediately
,
and
although
it
was
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
he
had
some
of
the
worst
quarters
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
traverse
,
he
met
with
no
<UNK>

*
The
reader
may
ask
,
``
How
came
<PROPER_NOUN>
here
?
''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
eagerly
.
``
And
where
is

is
certainly
some

-
<PROPER_NOUN>
''
While
reading
this
letter
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
his
heart
dilated
and
compressed
by
that
delicious
spasm
which
tortures
and
caresses
the
hearts
of
lovers
.

it
not
some
bad
affair

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

At
length
he
went
to
bed
,
fell
asleep
,
and
had
golden
dreams
.
``
There

``
There

it
possible

condescension
toward
a

appointed
a

listened

complaisance

<PROPER_NOUN>

in

He
had

lowering
his

looking

The

Tomorrow

In
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
plunged
into
a
<UNK>
,
continued
his
route
and
reached
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
instead
of
following
the
main
street
he
turned
behind
the
chateau
,
reached
a
sort
of
retired
lane
,
and
found
himself
soon
in
front
of
the
pavilion
named
.
Not
the
least
noise
was
to
be
heard
;
it
might
be
imagined
that
he
was
a
<NUMBER>
miles
from
the
capital
.
The
appointed
hour
was
about
to
strike
.
Through
this
window
shone
a
mild
light
which
silvered
the
foliage
of
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
trees
which
formed
a
group
outside
the
park
.
This
time
,
without
knowing
why
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
a
cold
shiver
run
through
his
veins
.
He
went
and
resumed
his
post
,
beginning
to
be
rather
uneasy
at
this
silence
and
this
solitude
.
He
then
thought
,
with
a
touch
of
vexation
,
that
perhaps
the
young
woman
had
fallen
asleep
while
waiting
for
him
.
Besides
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
but
<NUMBER>
years
old
,
and
consequently
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
<UNK>
habits
.
A
table
,
which
had
been
covered
with
an
elegant
supper
,
was
overturned
.
He
hastened
to
descend
into
the
street
,
with
a
frightful
beating
at
his
heart
;
he
wished
to
see
if
he
could
find
other
traces
of
violence
.
At
length
D'Artagnan
,
in
pursuing
his
researches
,
found
near
the
wall
a
woman
's
torn
glove
.
And
yet
he
said
,
to
reassure
himself
,
that
this
pavilion
perhaps
had
nothing
in
common
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
that
the
young
woman
had
made
an
appointment
with
him
before
the
pavilion
,
and
not
in
the
pavilion
;
that
she
might
have
been
detained
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
by
her
duties
,
or
perhaps
by
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
.
About
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
boatman
had
taken
over
a
young
woman
,
wrapped
in
a
black
mantle
,
who
appeared
to
be
very
anxious
not
to
be
recognized
;
but
entirely
on
account
of
her
precautions
,
the
boatman
had
paid
more
attention
to
her
and
discovered
that
she
was
young
and
pretty
.
He
again
ran
back
to
the
chateau
.
The
gate
of
the
enclosure
was
shut
;
but
he
leaped
over
the
hedge
,
and
in
spite
of
the
barking
of
a
<UNK>
dog
,
went
up
to
the
cabin
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
ceased
knocking
,
and
prayed
with
an
accent
so
full
of
anxiety
and
promises
,
terror
and
<UNK>
,
that
his
voice
was
of
a
nature
to
reassure
the
most
fearful
.
cried
he
,
``
listen
to
me
;
I
have
been
waiting
for
someone
who
has
not
come
.
The
window
was
again
opened
slowly
,
and
the
same
face
appeared
,
only
it
was
now
still
more
pale
than
before
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
ask
me
nothing
;
for
if
I
dared
tell
you
what
I
have
seen
,
certainly
no
good
would
befall
me
.
''
The
old
man
read
so
much
truth
and
so
much
grief
in
the
face
of
the
young
man
that
he
made
him
a
sign
to
listen
,
and
repeated
in
a
low
voice
:
``
It
was
scarcely
<NUMBER>
o'clock
when
I
heard
a
noise
in
the
street
,

was
wondering
what

could
be
,
when
on
coming
to
my
door
,
I
found
that
somebody
was
endeavoring
to
open
it

cried
I
,
`

<UNK>

go

The
<NUMBER>
men
brought
the
carriage
up
quietly
,
and
took
out
of
it
a

,
stout
,
short
,
<UNK>
,
and
<UNK>
dressed
in
clothes
of
a

color
,
who
ascended
the
ladder
very
carefully

looked
suspiciously
in
at
the
window
of
the
pavilion
,
came
down
as
quietly
as
he
had
gone
up
,
and
whispered
,

Then
I
saw
no
more
;

I
heard
the
noise
of
breaking
furniture

His
<NUMBER>
companions
were
already
on
horseback

``

resumed
the
old
man
,
upon
whom
this
mute
despair
certainly
produced
a
greater
effect
than
cries
and
tears
would
have
done
,
``

so

did
not

``

cried
he

``

had
appointed

perceived
through

was

with

he

''
These

guide

I

Only
<NUMBER>

the

gave
me
his

I
was
forced

turn

out

that

something

And
what
did

do

Now

he
was
accustomed
to
walk
with
his

on

behind
the

border
the

,
and
when
he
saw
a

alone

the

immediately
prevailed
in
his
mind
.
``
And
what
was
the
end
of
this
worthy

?
''
Then
they
came
and
boasted
of
their
fine
exploit
in
the
cabaret
of
the
next
village
,
where
my

and
I
were
drinking
.
''
``
Then
,
as
in
leaving
the
cabaret
they
took
different
directions
,
my

went
and
hid
himself
on

road
of

I
on

``
Yes

``

''
We
loved
sporting
of
all
kinds
better
than
anything
;
so
that
he
related
to
me
how
in
the
plains
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
the
natives
hunt
the
tiger

the
wild
bull
with

<UNK>

they
throw

<UNK>
the

with
such
nicety
;
but
in
face
of
the
proof
I
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
recital
.
Our
host
has
a
well

furnished
cellar
the
key
of
which
never
leaves

only
this

But
there
the
confidence
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
.
For
the

,
as
he
reckoned
upon
returning
by
the

route
in

<NUMBER>
days
,
if

were
still
at

he
would
call

on

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
said
nothing

of

or

In

projects
of
intrigue
for

,
and
determined
as
he
was
to
make
his

friends
the
instruments

his
fortune
,
D'Artagnan
was
not
sorry
at
getting
into
his
grasp
beforehand
the
invisible
strings
by
which
he
reckoned
upon
moving
them
.
How
he
had
found
grace
in
the
eyes
<UNK>
the
minister
,
he
did
not
know
;
but
without

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
revealed
this
to
him
if
the

had
found
him
at
home
.
We
depart
from
<NUMBER>
place
,
and
arrive
at
another

that
is
all
.
He
shook
his
head
,
perceived
the
cabaret
at
which
he
had
left
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
putting
his
horse
to
the
trot
,
he
shortly
pulled
up
at
the
door
.
``
My

''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

In

the

had
always
been

would
throw
aside

The
union

physical

moral

had
produced
the
effect
so
long
desired

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
very
little
heed
of
the

discourse

as
he
had
no

he
simply
moved

out

with

turned

The

half
drawn

admitted
the

calculated

His

hanging
down

his

In

contemplating
with
ecstasy

the

at

emptying
sadly
a

of
the
famous
Spanish
wine
he
had
brought
back
with
him
from

journey
into

Although
D'Artagnan
was
not
of
a
very
<UNK>
character
,
the
mercer
's
pretty
wife
had
made
a
real
impression
upon
his

Now
,
in

it
was
certainly
the
man

had
carried
off

<PROPER_NOUN>
the

as
he
had
carried

off

He
rode
up

looking
to

out

<PROPER_NOUN>
leaned
upon
the
neck
of

in

approached

The
conversation
took
place
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
a
language
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
understand
;
but
by
the
accent
the
young

plainly
saw
that
the

was
in
a
great
rage

He
approached

taking

said

addressed
some

to

The

cast
an

He
found

reclining
upon

where
he
was
waiting

as

said

for

immediately
sent

for

on

arrival
made

D'Artagnan
employed
himself

they
animated

A

drew
near

entered

and
joined

over

knew

listened
to

then
shook
his

recommended

of
bitterness

he

waited

as

was
drawn
by

at

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
then
turned
round
and
described
the
combat
without

a
single
detail

When
he
had
finished
,
he
went
to
a
table
upon
which
was
a

with
Spanish
wine
and
glasses
.
He
did
not

however

lose
sight
of

and
in
a
mirror
he
perceived
the
change
that
came
over

face

She
spoke
some
words

thereupon
requested

himself
on

of
the
urgency

that
had
called

away

and
charging
his

to
obtain
his
pardon

The
conversation
took
a
cheerful
turn

was

To
all
the

which
escaped
our

replied
with
a
smile
of
kindness
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
again
on
the
morrow
,
and
was
still
better
received
than
on
the
evening
before
.
He
launched
into
a
<UNK>
of
his
Eminence
,
and
said
that
he
should
not
have
failed
to
enter
into
the
Guards
of
the
cardinal
instead

At
the

hour
as
on
the
preceding
evening
,
D'Artagnan
retired
.
Every
evening
,
either
in
the
antechamber
,
the
corridor
,
or
on
the
stairs
,
he
met
the
pretty
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
His
heart
beat
,
but
not
like
<PROPER_NOUN>

with
a
young
and
impatient
love
.
And
then
he
-
a
<UNK>
on
the
earth
,
a
man
without
fortune
,
a
man
without
family
,
a
soldier
accustomed
to
inns

cabarets
,
<UNK>
,
and
<UNK>
,
a
lover
of

forced
to
depend
upon
chance
treats
-
was
about
to
partake
of
family
meals
,
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
a
comfortable
establishment
,
and
to
give
himself
up
to
those
little
attentions
which
``
the
harder
<NUMBER>
is
,
the
more
they
please

''
as
old
soldiers
say
.
The
approach
was
not
such
as
to
<UNK>
people
-
an
<UNK>
,
dark
passage
,
a
staircase
half
-
lighted
by
bars
through
which
stole
a
glimmer
from
a
neighboring
yard
;
on
the
first
floor
a
low
door
studded
with
enormous
nails
,
like
the
principal
gate
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
all

<NUMBER>
clerks
and
a
half
,
which
,
for
the
time
,
argued
a
very
extensive
<UNK>
.
``
It
is
my
cousin

''
They
reached
the
office
of
the
procurator
after
having
passed
through
the
antechamber
in
which
the
clerks
were
,
and
the
study
in
which
they
ought
to
have
been
.
<UNK>
might
be
heard
at
a
distance
through
all
these
open
doors

said
the
procurator
,
rising
,
yet
supporting
his
weight
upon
the
arms
of
his
cane
chair
.
During
the
last
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
months
that
this
weakness
had
been
felt
,
the
worthy
procurator
had
nearly
become
the
slave
of
his
wife

``
By

female
side

believe

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had

since
the
arrival

,
frequently
cast
his
eyes
with
great
uneasiness
upon
a
large
chest
placed
in
front
of
his
oak
desk
.
It
appeared
likewise
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
less
affected
by
it
on
her
part
,
for
she
added
,
``

must
entreat

give

can
call

This
succor
,
which
came
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
the
moment
in
which
he
was
attacked
in
his
<UNK>
hopes
,
inspired
much
gratitude
in
the
Musketeer
toward
the
procurator

wife
.
Their
jaws
moved
<UNK>
with
fearful
<UNK>
.
They
look

have
not
eaten

said
he
;
``
here
is
a

is

was
served
first

.
``

see

said
the
procurator
,
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
tragic
.
``

drew
the

toward

skillfully
detached

great

placed

cut
off

put

raised
the

for

and
then
returned
the

otherwise
intact
to
the

in

The
time
for

came

<PROPER_NOUN>
ate
his
wing
of
the
fowl
timidly
,
and
shuddered
when
he
felt
the

of

under

the

was
successively
<UNK>
in

the
result

led

up

opened

Kitty
breathed

he

he

Midnight
sounded

almost
at

the

finding

had
no

that
it
was

of
an

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
provoked

thus

<PROPER_NOUN>
departed
,
scarcely
knowing
what
to
think

as
he
was
a
youth

did
not

lose
his

,
while
continuing
to
pay
his
court
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
framed

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
promise

bring

that

on
the

morning

As

D'Artagnan

home

She
belonged
body

soul
to

D'Artagnan
colored
and
grew
pale
several

in
reading
this
billet

``
Oh

yes

I
know
what

How

She
has
no
occasion
to
teach
me
the
way
in
which
a

of
spirit
may
obtain
his
pardon
.
It
was
even
,
according
to
our
present
manners
,
something
like
an
infamous
action
;
but
at
that
period
people
did
not
manage
affairs
as

do
today

By
<PROPER_NOUN>

chamber
he
could
gain
that
of
her
mistress
.
``
There

''
said
the
young

,
handing
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
letter
sealed
;
``

Although
she
cried
freely
before
<UNK>
to
transmit
the
letter
to
her
mistress
,
she
did
at
last
so
decide
,
which
was
all

wished

They
dined
apart
from

wherever

never

when

was

even
then

required

be
asked
twice

The

expressed

different

An

made
his

at

taking

opening

inlaid

scratched
at

had
no

bade

with
great

he

faithful

Is

He
,
having
seen

crossing
the

took
care
not

they
rang
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
recognized
her
present
,
and
could
not
at
first
comprehend
this
restitution
;
but
the
visit
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
soon
enlightened
her
.
The
procurator
,
seeing
he
was
going
,
invited
him
to
dinner

an
invitation
which
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
refused
with

cried
the

The

fancied
she
saw
him
in
a
brilliant
cloud

all
surrounded
by
<UNK>

<UNK>

who
cast
bags

money
at

thought
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
as
he
walked
away

Never
had
he
been
so
well
received

the
poor

was
so
sad
that
she
did
not

notice

condescension

<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
what

wanted

``

he
murmured

She
heard
him
enter

she
did
not
raise
her
head

The
poor
girl
,
under
the
caresses

<PROPER_NOUN>

lifted
her
head
.
He
did
not
therefore
allow
her

only
he
represented
his
action

<PROPER_NOUN>
slipped
into
the
wardrobe
.
And
to
all
these
questions
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
forced
to
put
on
a
pleasant
face
,
responded
in
a
stifled
voice
whose
<UNK>
accent
her
mistress
did
not
however
remark

solely
because
happiness
is
egotistical
.
``
What
is
that
noise

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
he

If
rage

sorrow
ever
torture
the
heart

it
is
when
a

receives

not
his

addressed

his

I
also

The
first
movement

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
to
return

<PROPER_NOUN>
added
,
``
No

no

At

he
felt

``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

It

some

this

then
all
the
ideas
of
vengeance
which
he
had
brought
with
him
had
completely
vanished
.
It
was
necessary
to
separate
.
He
was
engaged
in
an
adventure
so
singular
that
he
wished
for
counsel
.
While
thus
speaking
<PROPER_NOUN>
regarded
with
attention
the
sapphire
set
with
diamonds
which
had
taken
,
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
finger
,
the
place
of
the
queen
's
ring
,
carefully
kept
in
a
casket
.
``
It
is
beautiful
,
is
it
not
?
''
Have
you
<UNK>
it
for
your
diamond
?
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
voice
in
which
it
was
easy
to
detect
strong
emotion
.
He
tried
it
on
his
left
hand
;
it
fit
his
finger
as
if
made
for
it
.
And
yet
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
such
a
resemblance
should
exist
between
<NUMBER>
jewels
.
''
And
he
returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
ring
without
,
however
,
ceasing
to
look
at
it
.
let
me
look
at
that
sapphire
again
;
the
<NUMBER>
I
mentioned
to
you
had
<NUMBER>
of
its
faces
scratched
by
accident
.
''
and
he
pointed
out
to
D'Artagnan
the
scratch
he
had
remembered
.
``
And
you
-
sold
it
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
became
pensive
in
his
turn
;
it
appeared
as
if
there
were
<UNK>
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
soul
whose
depths
were
dark
and
unknown
.
I
do
not
know
her
,
but
a
sort
of
<UNK>
tells
me
she
is
a
lost
creature
,
and
that
there
is
something
fatal
about
her
.
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
On
reaching
home
D'Artagnan
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
waiting
for
him
.
She
wished
to
know
when
her
lover
would
meet
her
a
second
night
;
and
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
pale
and
trembling
,
awaited
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
reply
.
When
your
turn
comes
,
I
shall
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
of
it
.
It
would
be
wrong
to
judge
the
actions
of
<NUMBER>
period
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
.
And
whatever
might
be
-
considering
the
violent
character
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
the
danger
which
the
poor
girl
incurred
in
giving
this
billet
to
her
mistress
,
she
ran
back
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
fast
as
her

could
carry
her
.
``
The
answer

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
all
in
a
tremble
.
Then
all
at
once
,
starting
,
she
cried
,
``
My

Kitty
,
fearing
she
was
ill
,
hastened
toward
her
and
was
beginning
to
open
her
dress
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
started
up
,
pushing
her
away
.
``
I
faint
?
When
I
am
insulted
I
do
not
faint

I
avenge
myself

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
;
this
jealous
anger
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
his
revenge
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
asked
the
poor
girl
what
was
the
matter
with
her
;
but
she
,
as
her
only
reply
,
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
gave
it
to
him
.
Will
it
be
the
same
this
evening
?
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
you
know

He
desired
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
tell
her
mistress
that
he
could
not
be
more
grateful
for
her
<UNK>
than
he
was
,
and
that
he
would
be
obedient

``
Show
him

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
quick
tone
,
but
so
piercing
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
her
in
the
antechamber
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
then
made
an
extraordinary
effort
to
receive
him
,
but
never
did
a
more
distressed
countenance
give
the
lie
to
a
more
amiable
smile

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
the
same
time
the
fever
,
which
for
an
instant
abandoned
her
,
returned
to
give
luster
to
her
eyes
,
color
to
her
cheeks
,
and
<UNK>
to
her
lips
.
There
was
a
moment
at
which
he
felt
something
like
remorse
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
the
most
<UNK>
air
he
could
assume
,
``
can
you
be
cruel
enough

put

<PROPER_NOUN>
rapidly
drew
his

nearer

``

Milady
remained
thoughtful
and
undecided
for
a
moment
;
then
,
as
if
appearing
to
have
formed
a
resolution
,
she
said
,
``
I
have
an
enemy

''
``
A
mortal
enemy

''
D'Artagnan
at
once
perceived
the
ground
which
the
<UNK>
creature
wished
to
reach
.
``
Well
?
''
``
<UNK>
me
of
that
infamous

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

between

``

``
But
on

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
how
should
I
repay

And
he
drew
nearer
to
her
.
``
Ah
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
really
carried
away
by
the
passion
this
woman
had
the
power
to
<UNK>
in
his
heart
,
``
ah

that
is
because
my

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a

It
appeared

``

``
Yet

``

affecting
hesitation
in

to
make

believe
him
ignorant

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
if
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasm
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
You
love
me
,
you

''
Her
lips
were
cold
;
it
appeared
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
had
embraced
a
statue
.
Milady
seized
the
occasion
,
``
His
name
is

''
said
she
,
in
her
turn
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
,
and
that
he
had
committed
an
error
.
``
Yes

''
The
epithet
,
as
may
be
easily
understood
,
resounded
to
the
very
bottom
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
heart
.
``
Thanks
,
my

Besides
,
she
had
a

precautions

take

``
Fortune

Milady
answered
by
a
glance
which
said
,
``
Is
that
all

exclaimed
the
young

.
``
But
when
I
assure

It
will
be

''
The
poor
girl
almost
fainted
at
hearing
these
words
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
held
out
her
hand
to
him
,
which
he
kissed
tenderly
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
left
the
hotel
instead
of
going
up
at
once
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
chamber
,
as
she
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
do
-
and
that
for
<NUMBER>
reasons
:
the

,
because
by
this

he
should
escape
reproaches

the

opportunity

reading
his

and
endeavoring

to
fathom
those

He
wished
to
subdue
this

in
his

and
as
this
vengeance
appeared
to
him
to
have
a

sweetness
in

he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
renounce
it

With
this
light
was
extinguished
the

in
the
heart
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
imagined
himself
to
be
drawn
into
<NUMBER>

This
last
thought
of
love
<UNK>
her
to
make
this

sacrifice
.
And
then
our
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
that

quantity
of
<UNK>
which
we
know
he
possessed
,
compared
himself
with

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
asked
himself
why

he
should
not

When
the

calmer

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
not
the

forgetfulness
that

was
the

asked

<PROPER_NOUN>
kept
him
within

beforehand
with

irresistible
spirit
and
her
iron
will
.
``
You
can
not

in

it
appeared

an

<UNK>
his
hold
of
her
dress

remaining
mute

motionless

frozen
.
She
turned
upon
him
,
no

like

like

And
she
flew
to
a

inlaid
casket

stood
upon

dressing

opened
it
with

threw

with

bound
upon

She

tried

seize

sword
with
her
hands

<PROPER_NOUN>
kept
it
free
from
her
grasp

and
presenting
the
point
,
sometimes
at
her
eyes

sometimes
at

breast
,
compelled
her

glide
behind
the
bedstead

while

aimed
at
making

retreat
by

door

led
to

came

burst
into

falling
over

up

as

related
all

<PROPER_NOUN>
profited

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
the
letter
with

A
short
gallop
brought
them
to
the
road
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
the
day
began
to
decline
,
carriages
were
passing
and
<UNK>
.
Almost
instantly
a

with

fingers
placed
upon

either

He

therefore

trembling
not
for

for
the

who
had
evidently
exposed

this

If

had

Nothing

turn
him
from

It
resulted
from
these
<UNK>
that
everyone
entered
heartily
into
the
purpose
for
which
they
met
;
besides
,
it
would
not

playing
either

an
ill

for

these

were
always
ready

His
conduct

<PROPER_NOUN>
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
treachery

he
was
very
suspicious
of
the
political
relations
which
existed
between

all
plain
enough

ruin

This
smile
appeared
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
be
of
bad
augury
.
He
traversed
a
corridor
,
crossed
a
grand
saloon
,
entered
a
library
,
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
seated
at
a
desk
and
writing
.
He
saw
then
that
he
was
with

No

had
a
more
searching
eye
than
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
this
glance
run
through
his
veins
like

fever

``
There

said
the

``

``
Yes

resumed
the

with
a
smile
which
indicated

knew
the

as
well
as
he
who
wished
to
relate
it

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
correctly
informed

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
That
is
all
very
simple

had
business
in

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
his
hand
upon
the
queen

diamond
,
which
he
wore
,
and
quickly
turned
the
stone
inward
;
but
it
was
too
late
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
feared
I
had
incurred
disgrace
with
your
Eminence

''
As
a
proof
,
remember
the
date
of
the
day
on
which
I
had
you
bidden
to
come
to
me
,
and
seek
in
your
memory

what
happened
to
you
that
very
night

Besides
,
you
owe
me
some
thanks

<PROPER_NOUN>
became
more
and
more
astonished

And
the
cardinal
pointed
with
his
finger
to
a
chair
for
the
young
man
,
who
was
so
astonished
at
what
was
passing
that
he
awaited
a
second
sign
from
his
interlocutor
before
he
obeyed

``
By

But
it
appears
to
me
that
my

are
also
his

and
whoever
serves
in

''
Well

you
have
this
excuse

advancement

the

the
opportunity

offer
you

so
much
for

``
In

said
the
cardinal
,
placing
his

upon
a
bundle
of
papers
,
``

perhaps

``
I
will
try

replied
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
noble
confidence
.
I
will
have
my
eye
upon
you
,
for
I
shall
be
there

''
replied
the
cardinal
,
pointing
with
his
finger
to
a
magnificent
suit
of
armor
he
was
to
wear
,
``
and
on
our
return
,
well
-
we
will
settle
our
account
!
''
He
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
,
but
with
a
haughty
gesture
the
cardinal
dismissed
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
descended
by
the
staircase
at
which
he
had
entered
,
and
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
waiting
his
appearance
,
and
beginning
to
grow
uneasy
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
and
answered
nothing
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
to
take
leave
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
were
parting
to
meet
again
when
it
pleased
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
if
it
pleased
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Each
of
the
captains
then
led
his
company
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
the
king
held
his
review
The
king
was
dull
and
appeared
ill
,
which
<UNK>
a
little
from
his
usual
lofty
bearing
.
The
procurator
's
wife
saw
him
pass
in
his
new
uniform
and
on
his
fine
horse
.
The
Musketeer
was
introduced
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
little
gray
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
at
seeing
his
cousin
all
<UNK>
new
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
wished
him
all
sorts
of
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
received
all
these
attentions
like
a
man
accustomed
to
such
demonstrations
,
only
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
he
lifted
his
hat
gracefully
,
and
waved
it
to
her
as
a
sign
of
adieu
.
Kitty
,
who
was
to
set
out
that
evening
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
waiting
in
the
next
chamber
.
To
a
look
of
interrogation
which
they
made
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
by
a
sign
that
it
was
he
.
It
is
,
then
,
interesting
and
even
necessary
that
we
should
say
a
few
words
about
it
,
particularly
as
many
details
of
this
siege
are
connected
in
too
important
a
manner
with
the
story
we
have
undertaken
to
relate
to
allow
us
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
.
It
became
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
destroy
this
last
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
-
a
dangerous
<UNK>
with
which
the
<UNK>
of
civil
revolt
and
foreign
war
were
constantly
mingling
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
at
once
Protestant
and
Catholic
-
Protestant
by
conviction
and
Catholic
as
commander
of
the
order
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
Ghost
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
a
German
by
birth
and
a
Frenchman
at
heart
-
in
short
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
a
distinguished
command
at
the
siege
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
said
,
in
charging
at
the
head
of
several
other
Protestant
nobles
like
himself
,
``
You
will
see

gentlemen
,
that
we
shall
be
fools
enough
to
take

<PROPER_NOUN>

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
everyone
knows
,
had
loved
the
queen

<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
that
in
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
combated
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
that
in
<UNK>
over
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
triumphed
over
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
in
short
,
that
in
humiliating
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
humiliated
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
eyes
of
the
queen
.
It
resulted
from
this
that
the
real
stake
in
this
game
,
which
<NUMBER>
most
powerful
kingdoms
played
for
the
good
pleasure
of
<NUMBER>
amorous
men
,
was
simply
a
kind
look
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
retired
into
the
citadel
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
his
garrison
,
and
threw
a
<NUMBER>
men
into
a
little
fort
called
the
fort
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
was
,
notwithstanding
,
anxious
to
set
out
;
but
his
illness
becoming
more
serious
,
he
was
forced
to
stop
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
,
however
,
arrived
without
accident
in
the
camp
established
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
of
the
tenth
of
the
month
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
the
year

His
reflections
were
not
very
cheerful
.
That
man
had
the
power
to
crush
him
,
and
yet
he
had
not
done
so
.
In
exchange
for
all
this
,
he
had
acquired
the
protection
and
good
will
of
the
queen
;
but
the
favor
of
the
queen
was
at
the
present
time
an
additional
cause
of
persecution
,
and
her
protection
,
as
it
was
known
,
protected
badly
-
as
witness
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
a
quick
eye
and
a
prompt
understanding
.
The
young
man
cast
a
glance
at
the
first
musket
and
saw
,
with
a
certain
degree
of
inquietude
,
that
it
was
leveled
in
his
direction
;
but
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
the
orifice
of
the
barrel
was
motionless
,
he
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
<NUMBER>
of
those

men
who
seek
a
ridiculous
death
in
order
that
it
may
be
said
of
them
that
they
did
not
retreat
a
single
step
.
As
he
,
however
,
had
no
other
hat
,
he
picked
up
this
as
he
ran
,
and
arrived
at
his
quarters
very
pale
and
quite
out
of
breath
.
The
ball
was
not
a
musket
ball
-
it
was
an
<UNK>
ball
.
It
may
be
observed
that
at
the
very
moment
when
,
thanks
to
the
ray
of
the
sun
,
he
perceived
the
gun
barrel
,
he
was
thinking
with
astonishment
on
the
forbearance
of
his
Eminence
with
respect
to
him
.
He
tried
in
vain
to
remember
the
faces
or
dress
of
the
assassins
;
he
had
escaped
so
rapidly
that
he
had
not
had
leisure
to
notice
anything
.
D'Artagnan
passed
a
very
bad
night
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
all
day
in
his
quarters
,
<UNK>
as
a
reason
to
himself
that
the
weather
was
bad
.
Monsieur
passed
along
the
front
of
the
line
;
then
all
the
superior

approached

<PROPER_NOUN>

captain

as

``

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his

,
and
said
,
``

<NUMBER>

They

seemed

D'Artagnan

turned
their

commenced

<PROPER_NOUN>

stooped
to
raise
him
and

but
at
this

<NUMBER>
shots
were
fired

He
resolved

know
with

had

fell
upon
the
body
of
his

he
were
dead

Fortunately
,
deceived
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
trick
,
they
neglected
to
<UNK>
their
guns
.
He
aimed
a
terrible
blow
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
avoided
it
by
springing
to
<NUMBER>
side
;
but
by
this
movement
he
left
a
passage
free
to
the
bandit
,
who
darted
off
toward
the
bastion
.
The
sword
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
slipped
along
the
barrel
of
the
<UNK>
weapon
,
and
passed
through
the
thigh
of
the
assassin
,
who
fell
.
``
Pardon

at

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
so
fierce

that
the

sprang
up
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took

made
him
go

urged

And

an

observing

succeeded

<PROPER_NOUN>
regained

threw
the

beside

Among

he
found

being
in

There

He
turned

Their

,
in

Milady
therefore
continued
her
voyage

and
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
embarked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
messenger

entered
the
port
in
triumph
.
It
was
<NUMBER>
of
those
rare
and
beautiful
days
in
winter
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
remembers
that
there
is
a
sun
.
This
boat
contained
an
officer
,
a
mate
,
and
<NUMBER>
rowers
.
Then
the
officer
began
to
pass
in
review
all
the
people
,
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
,
and
stopping
when
he
came
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
surveyed
her
very
closely
,
but
without
addressing
a
single
word
to
her
.
During
the
examination
of
Milady
by
the
officer
,
as
may
well
be
imagined
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
her
part
was
not
less
scrutinizing
in
her
glances
.
When
they
entered
the
port
,
it
was
already
night
.
The
officer
desired
to
have
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
packages
pointed
out
to
him
,
and
ordered
them
to
be
placed
in
the
boat
.
``
You
may
perceive

madame

by

that
I
am
an

navy

''
replied
the
young
man
.
Nevertheless
,
they
had
not
the
power
of
convincing
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
officer
followed
her
.
The
<NUMBER>
oars
fell
at
once
into
the
sea
,
making
but
a
single
sound
,
giving
but
a
single
stroke
,
and
the
boat
seemed
to
fly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
.
``
Is
this
carriage
for
us
?
''
``
At
the
other
end
of
the
town

''
So
strange
a
reception
naturally
gave
<PROPER_NOUN>
ample
matter
for
reflection
;
so
seeing
that
the
young
officer
did
not
seem
at
all
disposed
for
conversation
,
she
reclined
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
,
and
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
passed
in
review
all
the
<UNK>
which
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
.
``
But
we
are
no
longer
in
the
city
,
sir
,
''
said
she
.
``
Oh
,
this
is
too
much
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Milady
looked
at
the
officer
with
<NUMBER>
of
those
terrible
expressions
peculiar
to
her
countenance
,
and
which
so
rarely
failed
of
their
effect
;
anger
made
her
eyes
flash
in
the
darkness
.
Milady
reseated
herself
,
foaming
.
``
Then
you
do
n't
know
me
,
sir
?
''
There
was
so
much
serenity
,
coolness
,
mildness
even
,
in
the
voice
of
the
young
man
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
reassured
.
Almost
immediately
the
door
of
the
carriage
was
opened
,
the
young
man
sprang
lightly
out
and
presented
his
hand
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
leaned
upon
it
,
and
in
her
turn
alighted
with
tolerable
calmness
.
Immediately
several
men
appeared
,
who
unharnessed
the
smoking
horses
,
and
put
the
carriage
into
a
coach
house
.
With
a
single
glance
the
prisoner
took
in
the
apartment
in
its
<UNK>
details
.
The
officer
<UNK>
all
these
details
with
the
same
calmness
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
constantly
seen
in
him
,
never
pronouncing
a
word
himself
,
and
making
himself
obeyed
by
a
gesture
of
his
hand
or
a
sound
of
his
whistle
.
Put
an
end
to
my
doubts
;
I
have
courage
enough
for
any
danger
I
can
foresee

for
every
misfortune
which
I
understand

``
You
are
here
in
the
apartment
destined
for
you
,
madame
.
``
And
who
is
that
other
person
?
''
Some
voices
passed
and
faded
away
,
and
the
sound
of
a
single
footstep
approached
the
door
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
thought
she
recognized
this
shadow
in
the
gloom
;
she
supported
herself
with
<NUMBER>
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
advanced
her
head
as
if
to
meet
a
certainty

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
a
bow
,
half
courteous
,
half
ironical
;
``
it
is
I
,
myself

''
``
Is
yours
.
''
``
No
<UNK>

During
the
time
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
to
shut
the
door
,
close
a
shutter
,
and
draw
a
chair
near
to
his
sister-in-law
's
fauteuil
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
anxiously
thoughtful
,
plunged
her
glance
into
the
depths
of
possibility
,
and
discovered
all
the
plan
,
of
which
she
could
not
even
obtain
a
glance
as
long
as
she
was
ignorant
into
whose
hands
she
had
fallen
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
dropped
some
words
which
proved
that
the
conversation
she
had
with
the
cardinal
had
fallen
into
outside
ears
;
but
she
could
not
suppose
that
he
had
dug
a
<UNK>
so
promptly
and
so
boldly
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
they
wanted
to
revenge
the
past
,
and
not
to
anticipate
the
future
.
Milady
replied
to
this
question
by
another
question
.
``
I
come
to
see
you

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
without

how
much
she
<UNK>

given
birth

by

What

there
astonishing
in
that
?

``

demanded
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
tone
of
the
most

<UNK>

In

the
blow
was
direct

severe

the

pointed

with

and

to

shoulder
of

touched

toward

appeared
in

shade

the

summoning
to
his
mild
countenance
all
the
hatred
he
could
find
in

Meanwhile

the
cardinal
looked
anxiously
for
news
from

no
news
arrived
that
was
not
annoying

The

was

reckoned

Meanwhile

he
cast

over

so
many

of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
repeated
this
maxim
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
gossip
:
``
<UNK>
in
order
to
reign
.
''
<UNK>
to
that
time
,
whether
from
devotedness
or
from
want
of
power
to
act
against
it
,
this
maxim
,
without
being
generally
adopted
,
nevertheless
passed
from
theory
into
practice
;
but
the
notes
did
it
injury
.
Still
further
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
announced
to
the
mayor
that
at
length
the
great
league
was
about
to
declare
itself
against
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
that
the
kingdom
would
be
at
once
invaded
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
Spanish
armies
.
During
this
time
,
exempt
from
the
anxiety
of
its
only
and
true
chief
,
the
royal
army
led
a
joyous
life
,
neither
provisions
nor
money
being
wanting
in
the
camp
.
<NUMBER>
day
when
oppressed
with
a
mortal
weariness
of
mind
,
without
hope
in
the
negotiations
with
the
city
;
without
news
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
cardinal
went
out
,
without
any
other
aim
than
to
be
out
of
doors
,
and
accompanied
only
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
along
the
beach
.
The
other
<NUMBER>
were
occupied
in
opening
an
enormous
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
wine
;
these
were
the
lackeys
of
these
gentlemen
.
At
<NUMBER>
paces
from
the
hedge
he
recognized
the
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
as
he
had
already
perceived
that
these
men
were
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
he
did
not
doubt
that
the

were
those
called
the

that
is
to
say
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

<PROPER_NOUN>

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
With
a

bound
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
were
on
their
feet
,
and
saluted
with
respect
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
amid
the
general
fright
he
alone
had
preserved
the
noble
calmness
and
coolness
that
never
forsook
him
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

play
at

,

they
are
certainly
superior
officers
to

''
``
Your
Eminence
may
perceive
that

``
It

''
continued
the
cardinal
,
without
appearing
to
be
in
the

<UNK>
from
his
first
intention
by
the
diversion
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
started
,
``

``
Your

added
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
that

''
``
You
look
like

conspirators

''
replied
the
cardinal
,
knitting
his
brow
in
his
turn
,
``
the
secret
of
many
unknown
things
might
perhaps
be
found

``
And

''
The
cardinal
became
as
pale
as
death
;
lightning
darted
from
his
eyes
.
He
judged
that
the
match
would
be
so
much
the
less
equal
,
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
and

by

of
those

always
had
at

all
his

faded
away
into

Gentlemen

I
have
not
forgotten
the

you
served
me
as

The
<NUMBER>
young
men
,
standing
and
motionless
,
followed
him
with
their
eyes
without
speaking
a
single
word
until
he
had
disappeared
.
When
the
cardinal
was
out
of
hearing
and
sight
,
``
That

kept
bad
watch

''
``
Would
you

``
I

<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

that

Whose

One

``

his

On

her

failed
her

threatened

He

Yes

in

The
first
moments

her
captivity
were
terrible
;

convulsions

could

paid
her

``
No

Milady
perceived
a

;

would
not

refresh
her

still
further
,
her

The

did
not

resolved

sounded
in

drew
near

And
this
double
order
which
the

gave
to

proved

that

``
You

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
having
looked
at

from
the

on

he
stood
without

<PROPER_NOUN>
possessed

<UNK>
without

up

assumed

reclined

``
I
thought

<PROPER_NOUN>
;

reopened

again

made

took
the

with

retired
pensively

seating

in

was
indeed
behind
the
door
,
and
had
not
lost
<NUMBER>
word
of
this
scene

Silence
was
re-established

made
a

that

when
all
was
arranged

out
quietly
with

her
table
was
cleared

remarked

themselves
upon

she
continued
her
singing
with
inexpressible

feeling

``
Silence

No

<UNK>
the

of

was
fleeting
as

continued
:

seeing
the

the

took
in

in

But
the
night
passed
away
without
any
fresh
attempt
on

<UNK>
inflamed
my

;
I

to

It

that
all
was

By

wounded

with

Beyond

The

heated
his

still
more
;
the

exposed

exalted
his

His

At

Milady
wished

But

<UNK>
of

she
began

very
circumstantial
afterward

about

``

at

resumed
the

,
``

looking

you
rose

She
therefore
took
leave
of
the
abbess

and
went
to
bed
,
softly
rocked
by
the
ideas

vengeance
which
the

naturally
brought
to

But
alas

he

have
lent

The

The

introduced

``

seeing

she

Do

asked
the

Then
remarking
the

she
said
,

stretched
out

in

presenting
a

to

she
greedily
read
the

Tell

darting

she
remained

saw

silence

quiet
to
give

was

to
keep

Once

all

in

cast

around

and
arranged
the
topography

garden
in
her
head

On
reaching
the
courtyard
,
they
heard
the
noise
of
a

stopped
at
the
gate

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
up
to

apartment
quickly
:
she
there
found

and
gave
him
his
instructions

If

things
were
to
go
on
as
had
been

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
wrong
in
fearing

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
any
suspicion
.
This
man
goes
to
give
his
last
orders
;
take
the

thing
,
drink
a
finger
of
wine
,
and
let

be
gone

Here
is
night
coming

nobody
can
guess
where

are
.
``
Come

This
noise
acted
upon
her
joy
like
the
storm
which
<UNK>
the
sleeper
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
dream
;
she
grew
pale
and
ran
to
the
window
,
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
rising
all
in
a
tremble
,
supported
herself
upon
her
chair
to
avoid
falling
.
``
That

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
her
terrible
coolness

If
they
were
not

to
be
seen

it
was
because
the
road
made
an
elbow
.
<NUMBER>
of
them
preceded
the
rest

double
the
length
of
his
horse

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

without
being
able
to
make
a
step
,
glued
as
she
was
to
the
spot
by
terror
.
``
Thanks

the

they
heard
the
rolling

the

at

approach

set
off
at

Then

taking

Every

<PROPER_NOUN>
expected

not
return

All
at

she
uttered
a
loud
cry

joy

darted
toward
the
door
;
she

recognized

voice

the
young

At

the

became
livid

A
sigh
escaped
from
the
mouth
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
dwelt
for
an
instant
on
the
lips

<PROPER_NOUN>
wept

pointed
toward

summoned

At

o'clock

it
is
well
known

the

are
very

<PROPER_NOUN>
offered
the

the

refused

<PROPER_NOUN>
repeated
to

the

met

Fortunately

a

passed

who

<PROPER_NOUN>
offered

went

At

knock
,
however

steps
were
heard
inside

The

whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
come
so

the

There
was
no

Then

took
from

these

At

D'Artagnan
entered
the
chamber
,
and
demanded
what
was
to
be
done
.
As
to
the
key
,
it
had
disappeared
.
At
the
door
of
the
chapel
D'Artagnan
felt
his
courage
fall
anew
,
and
returned
to
look
for
<PROPER_NOUN>

but
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
disappeared

At

end

three-quarters
of

,
within
<NUMBER>

a

<UNK>
appeared
;
the

was
trampled
by

Everything
was

had
foreseen

The

remained
in

There

In

an
hour
he
returned

accompanied
by
a

masked

wrapped

It

a

sight

that

traveling

each
plunged

He

went

The
travelers
then
comprehended

there
must
be
some
reason
why
the
unknown
preserved
such
a
silence
,
and
ceased
to
address
themselves
to

They
spread
their
cloaks
.
The
moment
the

passed
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
were
approaching
the

a

sheltered
beneath

detached

from

advanced
into

on

``
Has

At

<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
to

opened

``

D'Artagnan
obeyed

turned

``

ranged

leaving

<PROPER_NOUN>
for

The

waited
for

resumed

I

All

Raoul
followed
the
well-known
road
,
so
dear
to
his

,
which
led
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
residence
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
he
approached
,
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
<UNK>
which
grated
under
the
weight
of
the
massy
<UNK>
;
he
also
fancied
he
heard
the
melancholy
moaning
of
the
water
which
falls
back
again
into
the
<UNK>
-
a
sad

funereal

solemn
sound

During
all
the
time
that
the
rupture
between
the
king
and
the
prince
had
lasted
,
the
prince
,
who
had
long
entertained
a
great
regard
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
in
vain
offered
him
advantages
of
the
most
dazzling
kind
for
a
young
man
.
It
resulted
from
this
<UNK>
line
of
conduct
that
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
never
been
conquerors
of
each
other
but
under
the
standard
of
the
king
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
however
young
,
had
<NUMBER>
victories
inscribed
on
his
list
of
services
,
and
not
<NUMBER>
defeat
from
which
his
bravery
or
conscience
had
to
suffer
.
A
year
,
then
,
had
passed
away
since
the
separation
of
the
father
and
son
;
a
few
letters
had
softened
,
but
not
removed
,
the
pains
of
absence
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
the
<UNK>
open
,
and
rode
straight
in
,
without
regarding
the
long
arms
,
raised
in
anger
,
of
an
old
man
dressed
in
a
jacket
of
violet-colored
wool
,
and
a
large
cap
of
faded
velvet
.
Then
there
was
a
change
of
scene
;
for
no
sooner
had
he
caught
sight
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
face
,
than
the
old
man
sprang
up
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
house
,
amidst
interrupted
<UNK>
,
which
appeared
to
be
<UNK>
of
wild
delight
.
The
comte
was
seated
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
and
books
;
he
was
still
the
noble
,
handsome
gentleman
of
former
days
,
but
time
had
given
to
this
nobleness
and
beauty
a
more
solemn

The
comte
closed
his
manuscript
,
took
the
young
man
's
arm
,
and
went
out
into
the
garden
with
him
.
In
fact
,
the
king
and
the
court
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
<NUMBER>
horsemen
,
<NUMBER>

,
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
horses
,
as
many
lackeys
as
masters
-
where
was
this
crowd
to
be
<UNK>
?
<UNK>
tapestries
,
and
<UNK>
with
great
gilt
chains
,
were
drawn
from
the
cupboards
;
an
army
of
the
poor
were
engaged
in
sweeping
the
courts
and
washing
the
stone
<UNK>
,
whilst
their
wives
went
in
<UNK>
to
the
meadows
beyond
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
gather
green
boughs
and
<UNK>
.
Already
numbers
of
the
citizens
whose
houses
were
furnished
as
if
for
a
siege
,
having
nothing
more
to
do
,
donned
their
festive
clothes
and
directed
their
course
towards
the
city
gate
,
in
order
to
be
the
first
to
signal
or
see
the
cortege
.
On
the
sides
of
this
triangle
had
recently
been
constructed
a
<UNK>
of
considerable
size
,
which
<UNK>
upon
the
street
remorselessly
,
according
to
the
familiar
uses
of
the
building
of
that
period
.
After
the
councilor
had
died
-
whether
by
<UNK>
or
naturally
is
of
no
consequence
-
the
house
had
been
sold
,
then
abandoned
,
and
lastly
isolated
from
the
other
houses
of
the
street
.
So
famous
had
the
house
become
for
it
,
that
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
prisoner
,
as
we
know
,
in
the
castle
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
once
sent
for
some
.
But
his
quality
of
an
Italian
was
no
recommendation
in
these
times
,
and
his
small
,
<UNK>
fortune
forbade
attracting
too
much
attention
.
He
began
by
<UNK>
the
public
to
sound
the
final
i
of
his
name
so
little
,
that
by
the
aid
of
general
complaisance
,
he
was
soon
called
nothing
but
M.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
is
quite
a
French
name
.
He
said
he
was
of
the
Venetian
school
,
doubtless
from
his
fondness
for
color
.
Perhaps
he
had
seen
the
famous
pictures
of
the
<UNK>
.
Besides
this
,
it
was
he
who
tasted
the
macaroni
,
to
maintain
the
pure
flavor
of
the
ancient
tradition
;
and
it
must
be
allowed
that
he
never
permitted
a
grain
of
<UNK>
too
much
,
or
an
atom
of
<UNK>
too
little
.
He
did
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
done
-
he
changed
his
style
,
and
painted
,
in
the
fashion
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
goddesses
rather
than
<NUMBER>
queens
.
I
say
this
for

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
well
as
for
yours

The
visitor
was
scarcely
gone
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
crossing
his
arms
,
said
:
``
Well
,
master
,
what

My

considered

``
He

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

At

even

when
the
memory

begins
to
be
faint
with

to
these

``

impossible

This
reasoning
was
<UNK>
-
Pittrino
obeyed
.
This
is
the
way
in
which
the
<UNK>
house
got
a
sign
;
and
this
is
how
the
hostelry
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
a
fortune
,
was
found
to
be
enlarged
by
a
quarter
,
as
we
have
described
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
anxious
for
gain
,
and
was
<UNK>
with
joy
at
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
was
dressed
in
black
velvet
with
jet
<UNK>
;
a
white
collar
,
as
plain
as
that
of
the
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>

set
off
the
whiteness
of
his
youthful
neck
;
a
small
<UNK>
mustache
scarcely
covered
his
curled
,
disdainful
lip
.
This
gentleman
,
then
,
had
arrived
alone
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
house
.
He
had
spoken
but
<NUMBER>
words
to
the
host
,
to
warn
him
that
a

of
the
name

would
arrive
,
and
to
desire
that
,
when
he
did
,
he
should
be
shown
up
to
him
immediately
.
All
at
once
the
movement
of
the
crowd
going
to
the
meadows
,
couriers
setting
out

<UNK>
of

<UNK>
,
<UNK>
in
motion

<UNK>
on
the

and

<UNK>
along
,
this
tumult
and
bustle
had
surprised
him
,
but
without
losing
any
of
that
impassible
and
supreme
majesty
which
gives
to
the
eagle
and
the
lion
that
serene
and
contemptuous
glance
amidst
the
<UNK>
and
shouts
of
<UNK>
or
the
curious
.
But
,
instead
of
the
person
he
expected

it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
appeared

and
behind
him

in

staircase

the

rendered

``

In
fact

the

spoke

there
is
the

The

from

plunged

emptied

He
dwelt
likewise
upon
the

of
his

turned
over
the
papers

pocket-book

convinced
himself

Parry
made
a

indignation

to

the

replied
by

a

He
resumed

Parry

whilst

was
screaming

singing

and
preparing

the

he
glided
out

where
the

who

gone

lost
sight

in

On

awaited

All
eyes

after
having
admired
the
young

so
handsome
and
so
agreeable
,
sought
for
that

<PROPER_NOUN>

much
otherwise

and

so

that

The

short

he
was
scarcely
<NUMBER>
feet

:
but
his

made
up

likewise
by

nobleness
in
all

and
by
considerable

became
red
with
anger
,
and
looked
around
him
to
ascertain
by
the
countenances
of
those
that
were
present
,
if
this
humiliation
had
been
prepared
for
him
.
The
study
of
the
young
king
,
which
had
begun
a
long
time
before
,
without
anybody
suspecting
it
,
was
continued
then
,
and
he
looked
around
him
attentively
to
endeavor
to
make
out
something

The

he
heard

rather
listened
to
nothing
else
;
and
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
of
the
circle
which
awaited
his
visit
,
his
object
seemed
to
be
to
come
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
extremity
of
the
<UNK>

It

have
been

that
he
wished
that

strike

at

any

The
court
was
young
,
it
was
true
,
but
the
avarice
of
the
cardinal
had
taken
good
care
that
it
should
not
be
brilliant
.
``
I

It
was
just
at
this
moment
that
the
king
caught
the
word
which
startled
him
.
There
was
doubtless
some
magical
influence
in
that
word
,
for
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
king
started
at
hearing
it
,
and
drew
<PROPER_NOUN>
towards
the
middle
of
the
circle
,
as
if
he
wished
to
put
some
confidential
question
to
her
,
but
,
in
reality
,
for
the
sake
of
getting
nearer
to
the
cardinal
.
``
Why
,
because
it
would
appear
that

as

``

Ah

And
the
fair

,
already
known
to
you
under

name

approached
them
,
timid
,
blushing

and
almost
bent
beneath
the
royal
glance
.
No

,
no
youth
,
no

,
could
stand
out
against
such
a
presentation
.
But
princes
are
thus
constituted
.
In
fact
,
if
the
poor
child
,
who
had
so
much
good
taste
as
alone
to
have
chosen
to
dress
herself
in
white
amidst
all
her
companions
-
if
that
dove

heart

so
easily
<UNK>
to
painful

,
had
been
touched
by
the
cruel
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

the
egotistical
cold

of
the

it
would
have
annihilated

''
From
the
moment
the
young
king
heard
these
last
words
,
he
appeared
as
if
he
had
received
a
poisoned
arrow
in
his
heart
.
After
he
had
a
<NUMBER>
times
bitten
his

stretched
his

like
a

all

evincing
his

-
after
having
uselessly
again
implored
his

and
the

,
he
turned
a
despairing
look
towards
the
door
,
that
is
to
say
,
towards
liberty
.
That
which
proved
still
better
that
this

was

and
was
accomplishing
a

to

<UNK>
,
therefore
,
as

in

,
``

service

``

Monsieur

<PROPER_NOUN>
hastened
to
give
orders
to
the
officers
who
presented
themselves
.
<NUMBER>
musketeers
,
opening
the
crowd
of
the
ante-chambers
and
the
steps
,
made
way
for
his
majesty
.
The
apartment
was
the
same
that
had
been
occupied
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
passage
was
commenced
by
a
small
square
ante-chamber
,
dark
even
in

finest

.
``
Ah
!
''
``
The

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

murmured
the
lieutenant
,
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
disdain
.
``
Look

''
said
he
,
taking
a
flambeau
from
the
hands
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
this
is
where

fell

``
Because
it
was
here
the

flowed

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
the
blood
penetrated
deeply
into
the
oak
,
and
it
was
only
by
cutting

out
that

succeeded

it
disappear

Perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
that

had
once
been
shown
him
at
the

and
which
,
as

''
replied
the
young
king
,
``
I
render
you
my
thanks
for
your
cordial
hospitality
.
''
Then
,
when
all
were
placed
,
he
chose
as
his
headquarters
the
ante-chamber
,
in
which
he
found
a
large
fauteuil

a
lamp

some

<UNK>
the

took

-
a
peculiarity
which
would
not
have
failed
to
strike
any
<NUMBER>
unacquainted
with

usages
of
that
court
.
On
the
king

side
,
on
the
contrary
,
were
darkness
,
silence
,
and
solitude
.
And
yet
it
was
possible
to
hear
from
the
side
of
the
house
occupied
by
the
young
king
the
music
of
the
banquet
,
and
to
see
the
windows
of
the
great
hall
richly
illuminated
.
His
eminence
crossed
the
court
,
conducted
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
himself
held
a

,
then
followed
the

to
whom

familiarly
gave
her

;
and
both
walked
chatting
away

like

He
had
come
straight
up
to
the
castle
,
and
had
,
with
his
melancholy
countenance
,
wandered
round
and
round
the
palace
,
from
which
the
people
had
not

departed
;
and
finding
that
no

guarded

seeing

asked
the

The

without

directed

staircase
pointed
out
to

on

the

``

uttered

back

this

was
only
for

permitted
the

the

indiscreet
to
hear
every

These

pronounced

the

resumed

closed

This

this

the

at

about
to
be
named

Now

that
is
what
he

continued
the

in

Why

you

out
this

``
Your

Now
,
this

they
saw
that

colored
with
endeavoring

conceal
the

at

at

to

and
they
so
thoroughly
remarked
all
I
have
said

that
they
saw
your

lips
<UNK>
these
words
:
`
Who

get

That
look
was
for
me
-
the
order
was
for
me
.
``
That
is
all
very
well

''
said
he
,
after
a
short
silence
,
during
which
he
endeavored
,
in
vain
,
to
make
his
officer
lower
his
eyes
.
``
Thank
you
,
monsieur

''
said
the
king
at
last
.
And
he
went
to
the
door
,
allowing
his
spurs
to
<UNK>
in
true
military
style
.
``
Now
then
,
''
murmured
the
officer
,
``
he
is
coming
to
it
at

``
From

''
``
And
you
will
accompany

''
``
You

In
fact
,
the
king
dismissed
him
with
a
gracious
wave
of
the
hand
.
``
Love
urges
him
on

The

<UNK>
furiously
under
the
effects

which
stole
in
through
the

cut
the

this

gave
an

made
an

as
complacently

<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
could
have
done
-
I
heard
him
,
and
I
know
the
meaning

That
is
the
cause

the

the

Because
I
have

And
the
lieutenant
snapped
his
fingers
in
disdain

The
idea
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
giving
anything
!
and
he
laughed
in
a
subdued
voice

<NUMBER>
minutes
after
this
he
was
asleep
,
with
his
hands
clenched
and
his
lips
apart
,
giving
escape
,
not
to
his
secret
,
but
to
a
sonorous
sound
,
which
rose
and
spread
freely
beneath
the
majestic
roof
of
the
ante-chamber
.
He
then
descended
the
little
staircase
,
went
out
at
a
<UNK>
door
,
and
perceived
at
the
end
of
the
wall
a
mounted
horseman
holding
another

by
the

``
Follow

the

``
That

sufficient

replied
the
officer
,
fully
instructed
in
the

his
search
.
It
required
only
<NUMBER>
glance
to
assure
him
that
these

the

he
was
in

he
therefore
turned
his

and
rode
back
to
the

``
Please

I
complained
of
being

Her

spoke
more

the

from

bursting
at

having

between

laden
with

sighed
along

and
wrinkled
the

all

of
the
day

all

all

intoxicated

who

At

the

shine
in

``
Then

He
stopped

said
hastily

said
the

coloring

``

``
Oh

A
long
silence
followed
these

the

had
pronounced
with
a
perfectly
true

feeling
.
``
See

she

said

The

detained

seized

he
pressed
to
his

despair
prevailing
over
the
resolution

made

start

so
really
had

The
officer
uttered
something
so
like
a
roar
that
it
frightened
the
horses
.
The
officer
still
held
the
horse
by
the
bridle

and
had
not
lost
all
hope

seeing

recover
his

The
lieutenant
,
patient
as
a
god
who
has
eternity
behind
and
before
him
,
still
hoped
for
a
return
of
energy

The
king
summoned
his
gentleman
.
``
Your

The
officer
entered

sire

why
does
your

give

``
Has

``
How

The

made
a
movement
of
surprise

the
officer
remained
as
motionless
as

``
What

''
``
It

said
the

looking
at
the

who
wore
his

with
an
ease
that
would
have
caused
envy
in
a
young
man
,
``

Therefore

interrupted
the

``

the

full
of
majesty

the

with
bitterness

``

If

enough

The
king
knitted
his
brow
,
for
he
saw
a
bitter
raillery
beneath
the
words
of
the
officer
.
The
officer
,
who
had
been
twisting
his
hat
about
in
his
hands
,
with
an
embarrassed
air
,
for
several
minutes
,
raised
his
head
at
these

To
tell
the

is
a

heart

as

of

The
officer
threw
his
hat
upon
a
table
,
and
his
countenance
,
always
so
intelligent
and
martial
,
assumed
,
all
at
once
,
a
strange
character
of
grandeur
and
solemnity

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

replied
the
officer
,
bending
his
knee
for
a
moment
,
``
never
was

more
respectful

``
Sire

years

few
people
have
worn
out
so
many
swords
in
that
service
as
I
have
,
and
the
swords
I
speak
of
were
good
swords
,
too

sire

If
ever
you
feel
an
inclination

know
it

do
so
,
sire

the
history
is
worth
the
trouble

it

I
who
tell

so

The
wonders

those

``
Eh

So

as
I
did
much
more

I
was
generously

``
Not

no

``
Oh

later

It
is

I
solicit

You

cried
the
officer
,
with
a
noble
air
;
``
the

has
forgotten

so
that

is
reduced

I
open

I
said

the

what

The
moment
of
silence
which
followed
this
vehement
outbreak
represented
for
him
who
had
spoken

for

had
listened

ages

Was

called

``
And
what

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
another
turn
in

still
wiping
the

from

in

terrified

``

``
You

``
And
you

said
the
king

And
the
king
,
with
a
hoarse
sob

which
was
lost
in
his
throat
,
passed
quickly
into
the

Besides

you

And
thereupon
he
left

went
straight

took

saddled

jumped
upon

set
off

His

gout
had
left
him
;
he
was
walking
about
his
chamber
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
,
listening
at
doors
and
looking
out

windows

``

he

had
read

the

passed

He
was
again

had
led
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
thanks

was
afraid

shadow

and
ashamed

he
marched
straight
up
to
that
shadow

and
then
became
extravagant
in
his
bravery
if
the
danger
proved
to
be
real

But
when
once
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
himself
near
the
field

action
,
all

feelings
but
that

disappeared
never

He
arrived
at

at

in

afternoon

<PROPER_NOUN>

The
play

continued

The

went
on
increasing

In

all
belonging

hostelry
threw
themselves
upon
the
stakes

and
many
a
piece

silver
was
picked

by
people

stole
away
whilst

were
<UNK>
with
each

``
Come

to

not

``
this

But
though

he
dealt

such

severe
blow
in
the
stomach
that
he
sent

rolling

howling
to
the

The

his

and
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
who
were
passing

recognizing

He
received

like
a

who
knows
that
nothing

being
offered
that
does
not
belong

and
then
said
he
would
go

walk
upon

port
till
supper
was
ready
.
``

engaged

<NUMBER>
of

<NUMBER>
years

maneuver

''
He
paid
himself
with
the
explanation
,
and
welcomed
the
effect
,
without
appearing
to
be
preoccupied
with
the
cause
.
<NUMBER>
others
were
more
frank
:
they
confessed
honestly
that
they
had
served
on
board
a
vessel
as
soldiers
on
punishment
,
and
did
not
blush
for
it
.
The
rendezvous
was
given
,
by
calculating
each
day
's
march
,
a
fortnight
from
that
time
upon
the
chief
place
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
not
to
create
any
jealousy
with
the
others
,
made
the
rest
go
forward
.
These
men
appeared
convinced
;
they
were
<UNK>
so
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
that
all
his
men
,
with
remarkable
intelligence
,
had
already
<UNK>
themselves
into
sailors
,
more
or
less
ill-treated
by
the
sea
.
He
learned
also
that
the
refusal

<PROPER_NOUN>

<UNK>
as
it
did
,
more
unfortunate
,
for
he
had
life

thought
,
and
he
hoped
and
<UNK>
by
turns
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
returned
to
his
isolated
abode
,
always
alone
,
slow
and
sad
,
amusing
himself
with
making
the
<UNK>
and
moving
sand
creak
beneath
his
feet
.
He
went
on
,
and
no
one
knew
whither
he
meant
to
go
,
although
not
only
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
watched
him
marching
with
a
firm
step
and
head
held
high
.
These
men
were
the
<NUMBER>
sole
political
representatives
of
that
revolution
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
I.
had
first
lost
his
crown
,
and
afterwards
his
head
.
Thus
<PROPER_NOUN>
by
persecuting
the
parliament
,
and
Monk
by
declaring
for
it
,
had
mutually
proclaimed
themselves
enemies
of
each
other
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
that
the
day
was
not
yet
come
,
the
day
marked
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
a
great
change
;
his
sword
,
therefore
,
appeared
glued
to
the
sheath
.
It
was
then
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
learnt
the
support
that
,
from
the
frontiers
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
lent
to
the
parliament
.
The
<NUMBER>
armies
came
in
sight
of
each

near
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
arriving
first
,
encamped
in
the
city
itself
.
As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
if
he
had
had
to
reflect
,
or
if
he
did
reflect
,
it
must
have
been
after
a
sad
fashion
,
for
history
relates
-
and
that
modest
dame
,
it
is
well
known
,
never
lies
-
history
relates
,
that
the
day
of
his
arrival
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
search
was
made
in
vain
throughout
the
place
for
a
single
sheep
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
little
accustomed
to
<UNK>
,
was
hungry
,
and
his
staff
,
at

as
hungry
as
himself
,
looked
with
anxiety
right
and
left
,
to
know
what
was
being
prepared
for
supper
.
This
consolation
was
only
efficacious
upon
a
very
small
number
;
but
of
what
importance
was
it
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
This
joke
satisfied
some
of
those
who
had
resisted
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
first
deduction
drawn
from
the
neighborhood
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
army
;
the
number
of
the
<UNK>
diminished
greatly
;
the
guard
took
their
posts
,
the
patrols
began
,
and
the
general
continued
his
<UNK>
repast
beneath
his
open
tent
.
The
kitchen-garden
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
longest
claws
of
the
abbey
,
extended
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
camp
.
But
between
these
fires

the
abbey
extended
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
unfolding
its
luminous
<UNK>
beneath
the
thick
shade
of
tall
green
oaks
.
Thus
his
soldiers
saw
him
,
after
what
he
<UNK>
called
his
supper
-
that
is
to
say
,
after
the
exercise
of
<UNK>
reported
by
us
at
the
commencement
of
this
chapter
-
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
eve
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seated
asleep
in
his
rush
chair
,
half
beneath
the
light
of
his
lamp
,
half
beneath
the
reflection
of
the
moon
,
commencing
its
ascent
in
the
heavens
,
which
denoted
that
it
was
nearly
half
past
<NUMBER>
in
the
evening
.
asked
the
general
.
``
I
have
had
my
supper

''
replied
he
,
quietly
,
``
and
was
comfortably

it

you
see

sent
us
word
that

fight
to-morrow
?
''
It
would
really
be
in
good
taste
to
send
back
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
both
his
fish
and
his
fishermen
,
unless

''
and
the
general
reflected
an
instant
.
``
The
leader
spoke
some
few
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

An
officer
immediately
went
to
fetch
them
.
``
And
you
say
they
were
carrying
fish
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
camp
?
''
At
this
moment
the
officer
returned
,
bringing
the
leader
of
the
fishermen
with
him
.
``
Do
you
speak
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
This
reply
was
made
much
more
with
the
lively
and
sharp
<UNK>
of
the
people
beyond
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
than
with
the
<UNK>
accent
of
the
countries
of
the
west
and
north
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
we
men
of
the
sea
,
''
replied
the
fisherman
,
``
speak
a
little
of
all
languages

''
``
You
appear
to
me
to
have
<UNK>
more
frequently
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of

<PROPER_NOUN>

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
.
And
now
speak
frankly
;
for
whom
did
you
<UNK>
them
?
''
``
And
why
did
you
go
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

camp
in
preference
to
mine

Monk
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
without
,
however
,
being
able
to
refrain
from
smiling
at
the
same
time
.
``
My
lord

his

into

``
We
were
returning
from

where
some
<UNK>
had
already
been
seen
,
when
a
sharp
wind
from
the
south
drove
us
from
our
course
;
then
,
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
against
it
,
we
let
it
drive
us
.
``
And
your
companions
,
where
are
they
?
''
said
the
patron
,
laughing
;
``
I
have
sailed
about
with

``
You
will
see
that
by

asked
the
general
.
``

He
looks
ill
,
and
I
do
n't
think
the
air

The
general
appeared
more
and
more
satisfied
with
his
examination
.
``
Always
the
same

said
the
fisherman
.
``
Well

``
No

think
so

The
fisherman
made
a
movement
of
his
head
and
shoulders
,
which
signified
,
``
If

appeared

This

enveloped
in

which
prevented
the

from
seeing
him
,
however

his

The

made
,
the

wished

The

After

He
walked

his

in

ready

As

night

alarmed

flew
away

The

obeyed

not

his

The

drew
back
in

whilst

The

by

Monk
held
out
his
hand
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Hush
!
Monk
listened
,
but
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
,
he
continued
his
route
,
Then
he
remembered
the
fisherman
,
and
looked
about
for
him
;
but
the
fisherman
had
disappeared
.
It
was
then
that
the
disappearance
of
the
fisherman
appeared
strange
,
and
that
a
real
suspicion
began
to
take
possession
of
his
mind

Monk
then
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
oar
over
the
marsh
on
the
right
.
Such
a
summons
,
for
which
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
,
appeared
unworthy
of
him
.
The
sergeant
,
with
his
head
raised
,
appeared
to
be
watching
the
moment
when
the
gentleman
should
appear

asked

<PROPER_NOUN>
fancied
he
could
detect
an
air
of
<UNK>
bonhomie
upon
the
countenance
of
the
sergeant
;
but
the
adventure
of
the
vault
might
have
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
man
,
and
it
was
not
surprising
that
he
allowed
some
of
the
feelings
which
agitated
his
mind
to
appear
in
his
face
.
This
fresh
guard
was
commanded
by
the
aid-de-camp
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
on
their
way
,
fixed
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
looks
so
little
encouraging
,
that
the
Frenchman
asked
himself
whence
arose
,
with
regard
to
him
,
this
vigilance
and
this
severity
,
when
the
evening
before
he
had
been
left
perfectly
free
.
Neither
of
the
officers
had
seen
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
consequently
neither

knew
him

``

said
the
lieutenant
,
``

The

at

Are
we
not

carry
our

to
extremity
?
``
Yes

came
hither
to

with

<PROPER_NOUN>

and
ask

yes

the

being

doubtless

unable

begged
me

promising
me
that

''
said
he
,
``
although

be
now
persuaded

It

Now

the

''
Well
!
My
honor
is
concerned

ascertaining
what
has
become
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
to
such
a
point
,
that
if
you
were

say
to

,
`
Depart

The
lieutenant
made
a
sign
to
the
other
<NUMBER>
officers
.
We
are
wrong
in
alarming
ourselves
;
his
absence
will
,
doubtless
,
be
of
short
duration
;
therefore
,
let
us
beware
,
lest
by
a
<UNK>
which
the
general
would
consider
a
crime
,
of
making
his
absence
public
,
and
by
that
means
<UNK>
the
army
.
Give
me
whatever
guard
you
like
,
chain
me
if
you
like
,
but
leave
me
the
house
I
inhabit
for
my
prison
.
The
secret
remained
secure
,
but
hours
,
days
passed
away
without
the
general
's
returning
,
or
without
anything
being
heard
of
him
.
When
the
tide
is
rising
,
and
advancing
on
land
,
it
is
not
prudent
to
bring
the
vessels
too
close
<UNK>
,
for
,
if
the
wind
is
fresh
,
the
<UNK>
are
buried
in
the
sand
;
and
the
sand
of
that
coast
is
<UNK>
;
it
receives
easily
,
but
does
not
yield
so
well
.
The
only
noise
to
be
heard
,
then
,
was
the
whistling
of
the
night
breeze
among
the
bushes
and
the
<UNK>
of
the
downs
.
In
consequence
of
this
order
,
several
muskets
immediately
glittered
in
the
feeble
light
reflected
from
that
mirror
of
the
heavens
,
the
sea
;
and
the
oblong
<UNK>
of
which
we
spoke
,
containing
no
doubt
some
contraband
object
,
was
transported
to
land
,
with
infinite
precautions
.
But
the
watchfulness
,
instead
of
alarming
the
<UNK>
man
,
appeared
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
give
him
great
joy
,
for
his
voice
might
perhaps
have
proved
insufficient
to
rouse
the
people
of
the
house
,
whilst
,
with
an
auxiliary
of
that
sort
,
his
voice
became
almost
useless
.
``
What
do
you
want

''
``
I
want
to
speak
to
him

''
you
ask
too
much

replied
the
voice
,
patient
and
<UNK>
as
that
of
an

``

uttered
an
exclamation

gave
a
shrill
and
prolonged
whistle
,
which
he
repeated
<NUMBER>
times
through
the
silence
of
the
night

But
before
he

fixed
his

inclosed

him

he

He

The

once
in

D'Artagnan
dismissed

The

by
another

Therefore

to

replied

Monk
<UNK>
demanded
a

for

From

nothing

<UNK>

then

And
this
was

Consequently

all

the

How

In
addition
to
all
this
,
a
loud
murmur
was
heard
along
his
passage
,
which
did
not
die
away
till
some
time
after
he
had
passed
.
Whilst
saying
these
words
,
a
bitter
feeling
gave
to
these
words
of
the
queen
a
most
hateful
expression
;
whereas
the
brow
of
the
king
,
calm
and
<UNK>
,
on

was
without
the

He
listened
to
Fouquet
paying
the
most
charming
compliments
to
the
queen
upon
her
hand
and
arm
.
``
Yes

;

I
received
from

<NUMBER>
<UNK>
of
very
fast

,
as
I
had
been
assured

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
caught
her
thought
.
``
Truly
not

madame

the

only
await
the
orders

enter

and
if
I
allowed
myself
to
try
them
,
it
was
only
for
fear

offering

anything

Fouquet
darted
a
haughty
glance
at
the
queen-mother

who
appeared
to
triumph
at
the
false
position
in
which
the
minister
had
placed

replied

anxiously

said
the

passing
the

to
his

as

reading

convince

in
the

at

<PROPER_NOUN>
replied
,

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Do

The
king
and
the
court
followed
him
thither
.
The
cardinal
had
,
as
we
have
said
,
great
faith
in
the
<UNK>
of
his
secretary
;

the
sum
was
a
large
<NUMBER>
,
and
whatever
might
be
the
genius
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
time

the
cardinal
thought
to
himself
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
also
might
possibly
have
been
mistaken
,
and
that
there
was
at

as
much
chance
of
his
not
being
damned
,
as
there
was
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

Every
time
that
the
door
opened
,
he
turned
sharply
round
towards
that
door
,
expecting
to
see
the
return
of
his
unfortunate
donation
;
then
,
deceived
in
his
hope
,
he
fell
back
again
with
a
sigh
,
and
found
his
pains
so
much
the
greater
for
having
forgotten
them
for
an

.
<UNK>
<UNK>
had
been
administered
to
the
cardinal
,
who
,
faithful
to
his
habits
of
dissimulation
,
struggled
against
appearances
,
and
even
against
reality
,
receiving
company
in
his

as
if
he
only
suffered
from
a
temporary
complaint
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
absent
from
the

for
<NUMBER>
days
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that

which
so
constantly
preoccupied
the
cardinal
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
make
out
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
conduct
.
For
what
purpose
could
<PROPER_NOUN>
wish
for
an
interview
?
``
His

cried
he
,
making
a

<PROPER_NOUN>

who
was
seated
at

of
the
bed
,
and
which
the

understood
perfectly

But
this
was
not
what
<PROPER_NOUN>
expected
;
therefore
he
would
not

look
at
it

declaring

allowed
himself
to
sink
back
upon

that
is
to

with
all
the
despair
of

bowed
to

sat
down

still
very

very

in

<PROPER_NOUN>

drawing
from
his

holding
towards
the

the

to
considerations

unable

felt
burning
within

the

of

the

of

she
arose

left
the
chamber

heedless
of
thus
betraying
the
extent

astonished

for
<PROPER_NOUN>

he
appeared
only
to
have
said
something
quite
natural

adieu

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
whole
night
was
passed
in
anguish
,
common
to
the
dying
man
and
to
the
king
:
the
dying
man
expected
his
deliverance
,
the
king
awaited
his
liberty

<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
reappeared
no
more
in
the
cardinal

apartments
;
she
had
nothing
more
to
do
there
.
He
had
revised
his
will
,
and
as
this
will
was
the
exact
expression
of
his
wishes
,
and
as
he
feared
that
some
interested
influence
might
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
to
make
him
change
something
in
it
,
he
had
given
orders
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
walked
up
and
down
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
cardinal

bed-chamber
,
like
the
most
vigilant
of
sentinels
.
This
was
a
relic
of
the
old
customs
of
that
fencing
time
,
which
was
about
to
disappear
to
give
place
to
another
time
,
to
believe
that
death
could
be
kept
off
by
some
good
secret
thrust
.
But
the
<UNK>
which
followed
entirely
changed
the
face
of
things
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
uttered
a
joke

and
had
ordered
his

by
<PROPER_NOUN>

to
be

About
<NUMBER>
o'clock
his
nurse
awoke
him
by
entering
the
room
.

troubled

That

,
he
took
a
turn
to
the
stable
,
patted
his

then
,
having

he

neither

<NUMBER>

arose

Placed

This

ended

<PROPER_NOUN>
began

whilst
making

in

had

everything

No

Now
,
what

Then

I

in

I

instead

hold
in

I
should
ever
carry
the

of

Ah
!
Then
,
at

I
am
very
well
with

has
the
appearance

to
reign

And
now
let
us
see
!
``
Ah
!
poor
mortal
species

A
conspirator

a
real
conspirator

who
did
not
even
give

the
trouble
to
conceal
his
being
a

therefore

what

would
you
not
have
against
him

if
his

Now
,
then
,
let

see

Now
,
then
,
the
king
becomes
my

and
as
my

is
quits
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

let
him
beware
who
places
himself
between

These
reflections
once
made
,
he
increased
the
speed
of
his
horse
.
Thanks
to
this
mode
of
<UNK>
,
he
traversed
the
space
separating
<PROPER_NOUN>
from

The
<UNK>
purchased

completed

called

<UNK>
along

the

studied
the
country

traversed
reserved
and
silent

ever
seeking
the
most
plausible
pretext

reaching

seeing

a

floated
visibly
for

upon
the

Even
in
the

,
even
within

of
that
mysterious
isle

<UNK>
and

consecrate
its
wonders
.
The
ancients
called
it
<UNK>
,
from
<NUMBER>
Greek
words
,
<UNK>
beautiful
isle

He
also
learnt
that
the
best
way
to
get
intelligence
was
to
go
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
tolerably
important
city
at

mouth
of

Before
taking
his
place
at
table
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
acquired
,
as
was
his
custom

all
the
information

could
;
but
it
is
an
axiom

that

ought

not
unworthy

supping
with
the
gentleman
of
the

boots
and
still
older
horse
.

said
the
unknown
.
Besides
,
I
have
observed
you
have
a
horse
just
like
mine
,
and
that
the
host
,
no
doubt
on
account
of
that
resemblance
,
has
placed
them
side

side
in
the
stable

where
they
appear
to
agree
<UNK>
well
together

In
truth
,
monsieur

I
should
be
well
pleased

my

were
as

upon
my
honor

I
am
quite
at

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
replied
the
latter
,
with
whose
mind
and
person
we
have
been
making
so
free
,
``
you
do
me
much
honor

not
that
I

added
he

smiling
,
``
a
company

amuses
me
always

never

I
am
very
happy

At
this
opening
,
the
features
of
the
man
of
modest
exterior
relaxed
;
and
,
as
if
he
had
watched
the
moment
for
his
entrance

as

spoke

the

appeared

bearing

replied
the
stranger
,
with

full
.

``
And

I
can

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
;

``

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
clapping
his

``

blushing

take

observe

may
understand
that
in

in

this

not

so

``
With

``
Well

``

He
stretched
forth
his
hand
towards
the
piece
of
brass
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
seized
as
an
avowal
the
hesitation
of
the

and
his
eagerness
to
conceal
the
piece
of
brass
which
a
first

had
induced
him
to
take
out

But
-
an

not
in
this

Allow
me
to
inquire

of

of

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

the

the

returning
to
his

``
you
never

said
he
,
as
he
ended

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
like
a
man
who
has
an
answer
for
everything
;
then
he
pulled
out
-
still
from
his
pocket
-
a
little
metal
ruler

composed
of
<NUMBER>
parts

like

against

put

in

the

under

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
laughing
with
an
air
of
simplicity
so
stupid
,
that
the
poet
was
completely
his
dupe

thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself
,
``
this
must
be
cleared
up

''
Then
,
enchanted
with
his
rich
discovery
he
ran
upstairs
again
,
and
resumed
his
place
at
the
table
.
His
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
.
But
all
the
wit
D'Artagnan
employed
in
endeavoring
to
find
out
his
name
was
lost
-
he
could
learn
nothing

At
daybreak
D'Artagnan
saddled
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
fared
<UNK>
all
night
,
devouring
the
remainder
of
the

hay
left
by

Moreover
,
it
was
singular
that
this
traveler
and
his
lackey
should
have
remained
a
mystery
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
spite
of
all
the

addressed

who
appeared

<PROPER_NOUN>

the

of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
exactly
resembling
each

attracted
and
suspended
his
attention

At

moment
he
reached
the
little
port
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

<NUMBER>

shook
his

take
the
tide

If

to
lie
by
a

or
to
refresh
the

,
they
come
to

along

they
find
another

current

and
a

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

replied

as
<UNK>
,
the
fisherman
,
taking
off
his

cap
at
the
<UNK>
of
that
respected
name

D'Artagnan
therefore
patted
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
as
a
new
proof
of
his
charming
character
,
resumed
his
march
with
his

in
the
salt-mines

and
his

to
the
dry
wind

bends
the
<UNK>
and
the

diminished

in

eyes

the
consequence

the
proof

what
he

well
divined
at
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
put
<PROPER_NOUN>
into
a
stable

supped

went
to

on

took
a
walk
upon

port

rather
upon
the

passages
between

<UNK>

at
the

``
Any

``

``
Yes

The
fisherman
laughed
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
face
.
``
What

that

''
``
Yes

``
It

raised
his

<PROPER_NOUN>

their

,
and
mordioux
enough
to
have
astonished
his
musketeers
themselves
every
time
that
a
shock
given
to
his
line
by
the
captured
fish
required
the
play
of
the
muscles
of
his
arm
,
and
the
employment
of
his
best
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
,
within
half
a
league
at
most
,
the
blue
and
marked
profile
of
the
rocks
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
by
the
majestic
whiteness
of
the
castle
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
be
seen
of
it
,
owing
to
this
dazzling
light
,
but
the
salient
points
;
every
shadow
was
strongly
marked
,
and
cut
with
bands
of
darkness
the
luminous
fields
and
walls
.
How
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
can
a
landing
be
effected
on
that
isle
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
defended
so
completely
?
''
``
You
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
replied
the
fisherman
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
then
the
palace
.
''
there
are
some
soldiers
.
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
stamping
with
his
foot
.
The
movable
<UNK>
,
the
agitated
sailors
,
the
noise
of
the
water
on
the
pebbles
,
the
cries
and
<UNK>
of
those
who
wait
upon
the
shores
,
are
multiplied
details
of
that
sensation
which
is
summed
up
in
<NUMBER>
single
result
-
hesitation
.
The
large
stones
were
loaded
on
<UNK>
which
conveyed
them
in
the
same
direction
as
the
others
,
that
is
to
say
,
towards
the
works
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
as
yet
appreciate
neither
the
strength
nor
the
extent
.
And
yet
,
whilst
his
companions
carried
on
their
trade
,
giving
or
selling
their
fish
to
the
workmen
or
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
gained
ground
by
degrees
,
and
,
reassured
by
the
little
attention
paid
to
him
,
he
began
to
cast
an
intelligent
and
confident
look
upon
the
men
and
things
that
appeared
before
his
eyes
.
The
latter
had
<UNK>
,
and
the
<UNK>
of
the
works
called
successively
men
who
,
with
cords
,
tied
the
<UNK>
and
cut
the
lozenges
and
right
angles
of
<UNK>
destined
to
retain
the
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
.
The
works
had
this
peculiarity
,
that
instead
of
rising
above
the
earth
,
as
did
the
ancient
ramparts
destined
to
defend
a
city
from
<UNK>
,
they
,
on
the
contrary
,
sank
into
it
;
and
what
created
the
height
of
the
walls
was
the
depth
of
the
ditches
.
A
bridge
of
planks
thrown
over
the
<UNK>
for
the
greater
convenience
of
the
maneuvers
connected
with
the
<UNK>
,
joined
the
interior
to
the
exterior
.
A
plan
was
lying
open
before
him
upon
a
large
stone
forming
a
table
,
and
at
some
paces
from
him
a
<UNK>
was
in
action
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
to
draw
nearer
.
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
every
time
the
stone
escaped
them
,
they
bounded
quickly
backwards
,
to
keep
their
feet
from
being
crushed
by
the
<UNK>
stone
.
which
<UNK>
maneuvers
of
strength
.
said
he
,
``
what
is
all
this
about
?
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
The
man
with
the
feathers
went
up
to
the
stone
,
stooped
,
slipped
his
hands
under
the
face
lying
upon
the
ground
,
stiffened
his
<UNK>
muscles
,
and
without
a
strain
,
with
a
slow
motion
,
like
that
of
a
machine
,
he
lifted
the
end
of
the
rock
a
foot
from
the
ground
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
know
but
<NUMBER>
man
capable
of
such
a
feat
of
strength

''
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seized
with
stupor
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
at

``

In

discovered

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
just
been
discovered
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
,
after
the
embrace
,
came
reflection
.
``
How
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
you
come
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
``
Without

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
unwilling
to
give
his

time
to
recollect
himself
,
``
I
have
been
to
see

''
``
No

but
I
found

.
''
``
Why
should
he
not
Have
I
,

deserved
to
lose
his
confidence

''
``
My

,
a

always
leaves
traces
behind
him
on

I

think

poorly
of

if
I
were
not
sharp
enough
to
follow
the
traces
of

.
''
You
came
disguised

you
?
''
``
As

``

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
hoping
that

You
then
inquired

was
,
saying
to
yourself
,

there

So
you
understand
that
arriving
at

,
I
heard
of
the
splendid
fortifications
going
on
at

will
embrace

<PROPER_NOUN>
saluted
D'Artagnan
with
a
gracious
smile
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
immediately
took
the
offensive
.
``
No

It
was

which
made

ask

just
now

<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
he

committed

yes

Next

you
see
the

the

``
Here

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
the
conversation
with
his
usual
modesty

From
over
balconies
fell
long
white
sheets
stuck
all
over
with
bouquets
.
A
crowd
in
holiday
garb
appeared
through
the
<UNK>
of
incense
which
mounted
to
the
heavens
in
blue
<UNK>
,
and
clouds
of
<UNK>
<UNK>
as
high
as
the
first
stories

This
was
the
procession
.
His
head
,
full
of
graceful
majesty
,
was
covered
with
the
episcopal
<UNK>
,
a
<UNK>
which
gave
it
,
in
addition
to
the
character

sovereignty

that
of

and
<UNK>
meditation

He
raised
his
large
black
eyes
,
with
their
long
lashes
,
and
turned
them
without
hesitation
towards
the
spot
whence
the
exclamation
proceeded
.
<NUMBER>
thing
had
particularly
struck
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
knew
the
acuteness
and
intelligence
of
his
friend
,
he
feared
to
let
him
divine
the
secret
of
his
blush
and
his
astonishment
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
forced
to
give
way
;
indeed
,
he
was
little
short
of
being
flat
on
the
ground
.
Besides
,
speech
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
instead
of
<UNK>
his

,
always
completed
it
.
``
Observe

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
he
has
seen

as

-
see

what

But
the

had
passed
;
the
road
was
free
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
the
man
to
seek
for
a
useless

There
was
something
in

resembling
those
Roman

had
their
doors
always
surrounded
by
<UNK>

<UNK>
perfumes
were
mingled
with
the
perfumes
of
the

and
the
sea
.
oh
!
''
The
worthy
baron
<UNK>
himself
everywhere
rather
as
if
he
were
at
home
.
They
learned
that
His
Greatness
had
just
returned
to
his
apartment
and
was
preparing
to
appear
in
familiar
intimacy
,
less
majestic
than
he
had
appeared
with

He
<UNK>
,
on
entering

that
delicate
perfume
which
,
among
elegant
men

high

never

and
appears
to
be

in
the

it
has
become
the
natural
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
his
part
,
embraced
him
with
equal
ardor

This
maneuver
,
familiar
to
diplomatists

,
resembles
much
the
advantage
of
the
guard
which
,
according

had
asked
this

who
had
signed
it
without

It

not
improbable
that
a
most
aristocratic
origin
might
be
hunted
up
by
the
<UNK>
for
this
name

it

humbled
his

Malicorne
played
the
coquette
better

was
the

for
what
a
strange
future
she
was
reserved

in

cast

Fouquet
was

had
said

at
the
king
's
card-table
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
thoughtful

and
kind
in

manner

like
a

listened

from

cast

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

sighs
while

what
was
the

smiling
and
kneeling
at
a
distance
?
The
looks

cast

from
time

at
<PROPER_NOUN>

became
<UNK>
by

at
the

complexion

And
she
was
so

for

notwithstanding

dignity

and
the

despite
the
respect

were

eclipsed

Like

made
still

And

a

had
not

condescended

his

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
worshipped
this

of
<PROPER_NOUN>

a
keen

like

imperious

like
every

was
sensible
of

power

and
acquiesced
in
it
immediately
,
a
circumstance
which
induced
the
young
queen
to
raise
the
siege
and
retire
to
her
apartments
.
It
was
remarked
that
at

threshold

his
majesty
,
freed
from
every
restraint
,
or
not
equal

sighed
very
deeply
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
sighed
,
first
closing
her
beautiful
black
eyes
,
next
opening
them
,
and
then
,
laden
,
as
they
were
,
with
an
indescribable
<UNK>
of
expression
,
she
had
raised
them
towards
the
king
,
whose
face
at
that
moment
visibly
heightened
in
color
.
He
wished
to
speak
to
the
different
persons
there
,
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
mind
was
absent
.
The
king
only
recovered
his
attention
in
some
degree
at
the
moment
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
been
narrowly
<UNK>
for
some
minutes
,
approached
,
and
,
doubtless
,
with
great
respect
,
yet
with
much
perseverance

whispered
a
counsel
of
some

into
the
still
<UNK>
ears
of
the
king
.
``
I

Fouquet
waited
without
showing
<UNK>
;
and
the
king
resumed
,
answering
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
icy
smile
,
``

``

``

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
him
astonished
.
His
dress
concealed
the
blood
,
and
his
smile
the
rage
which
devoured
him
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
supped
very
agreeably
off
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
,
<NUMBER>
pheasants
,
and
a
perfect
heap
of
<UNK>
;
he
then
directed
his
body
to
be
<UNK>
with
perfumed
<UNK>
,
in
the
manner
of
the
<UNK>
of
old

and
when
this
<UNK>
was
completed
,
he
had
himself
wrapped
in
<UNK>
and
placed
in
a
warm
bed
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
up
:
``
Good-evening

said
he
,
and
his
searching
look
detected
his
host
's
sadness
and
disordered
state
of
mind
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
followed
every
movement
with
his
eyes
,
noticed
that
he
stretched
himself
upon
the

with
a
sort
of
feverish
impatience
.

left

reiterated

The

suddenly
raised
her

my

said
the

suddenly
,
as

collecting
her

,
like

preparing
for
a

``

``
It

trembling

``
It
is
probable

The
marquise
,
bewildered
and
overcome
by
these
cruel
attacks
,
which
had
been
calculated
with
the
greatest
nicety
and
precision
,
hardly
knew
what
answer
to
return

she
even
seemed
to
have
lost
all

No

it
would
be
<UNK>
for
me
to
make
the
first

You
tell
me
nothing

The
marquise
rose
,
pale
and
almost
lifeless
,
without
thinking
of
the
envelope
,
which
had
occupied
her
attention
so
greatly
at
the
commencement
of
the
conversation
,
and
which
was
revealed
at
the
first
step
she
took
.
``
Ah
!
''
The
blow
had
been
the
more
painful
on
account
of
its
being
unexpected

A
detestable
delight
at
an
approaching
downfall

<UNK>
efforts
to
attain
this
object
,
means
of
seduction
no
less
wicked
than
the
crime
itself

such
were
the
weapons
<PROPER_NOUN>
employed
.
The
spirit
of
thus
courageous
woman
soon
resumed
its
energy
,
no

overwhelmed
by
indulgence
in
compassionate
lamentations
.
``
Is
everything

``
Yes

The

The
marquise
remained
silent
for
a

then
said
calmly
,
``

On
this

however

she
admired
the
size

the
brilliancy

;
she
grieved
over
every

The

took
his

weighed

them

silently
made
his

In

By
the
by

I
was
forgetting
the

``

and
without

seeing
him
;
and
order
him
to
wait
for
me
in
a
carriage
.
''
``
Certainly
,
your

''
The
jeweler
bowed
and
left
the
house
,
directing
that
the
van
should
follow
him
closely
,
saying
aloud
that
the
marquise
was
about
to
have
her
plate
melted
down
in
order
to
have
other
plate
<UNK>
of
a
more
modern
style
.
The
jeweler
,
though
a
millionaire
,
was
a
modest
man
.
It
was
the
clerk
,
too
,
who
told
the
coachman
,
who
was
very
proud
of
having
a
marquise
to
drive
,
to
take
the
road
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Their
progress
,
it
might
be
said
,
was
majestic
.
The
weight
of
the
chest
was
so
great
that
the
clerk
was
obliged
to
get
the
coachman
to
assist
him
with
it
.
There
was
no
servant
to
be
seen
about
the
rooms
,
but
everything
was
prepared
as
though
some
invisible
genius
had
divined
the
wishes
and
desires
of
an
expected
guest
.
Her
deep
musings
,
melancholy
though
they
were
,
were
not
<UNK>
with
a
certain
vague
joy
.
This
idea
,
naturally
enough
,
was
the
first
to
present
itself
to
her
mind
.
To
secure
success
,
it
was
necessary
that
some
steps
should
be
seriously
taken
,
and
it
was
necessary
also
that
the
superintendent
should
comprehend
the
serious
position
in
which
he
was
placed
,
in
order
to
yield
compliance
with
the
generous
fancies
of
a
woman
;
all
the
<UNK>
of
an
eloquent
friendship
would
be
required
to
persuade
him
,
and
,
should
this
be
insufficient
,
the
<UNK>
influence
of
a
devoted
passion
,
which
,
in
its
resolute
determination
to
carry
conviction
,
would
not
be
turned
aside
.
He
would
resist
,
and
if
any
voice
in
the
world
could
overcome
his
resistance
,
it
would
be
the
voice
of
the
woman
he
loved
.
Was
it
not
the
same
with
Fouquet
,
notwithstanding
his
genius
and
his
<UNK>
of
conduct
,
as
with
those
conquerors
on
the
field
of
battle
who
shed
tears
when
they
have

smiled

The
valet
held
a
wax-light
;
the
cardinal
took
a
key
from
his
bureau
and
opening
the
door
of
a
secret
stair
descended
into
the
court
of

From
time

noises
came
in

direction

The
cardinal
envied
that
composure
,
which
he
attributed
to
the
habit

meeting
danger
;
but
none
the
less
he
conceived
for
the

he
had
for

placed
himself
,
that
consideration
which
even
prudence
pays

The

replied
by
pointing
out
to
him
an
officer
who
was
conversing
,
on

,
his

upon

neck
of
a

on

``

cried
the

to

``

opened

The

was
crowded
by

D'Artagnan

him

evident

bound

Not

up

And

looked

He

the

A

entered

The

delicious

nodded

up

He
endeavored

cheer

up
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
an

acquainted

was
likely
to
set

As
to
getting
him
drunk
,
the

could
n't
hope
to
do
that

and
he
laughed
at
the

he
asked

Nothing
could
be

he
had

A

is
the

it

wonderful
what

may
be
wrought
in
it
by
a

And
what

It

true
that

had
not

been
<UNK>
faithful
to
him

but
she
had
remembered
him

that

something

The
duke
waited
until
midnight
,
turning
on
his
mattress
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
his
<UNK>
.
He
dreamed
that
he
was
endowed
with
wings

he
wished
to
fly
away

He
was
in
a
subterranean
passage
by
which
he
was
to
leave
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
sides

the
walls
seem
to
close
in

even
to
press
against
him
.
Then
at
the
other
extremity
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
those
who
were
pursuing
him
.
At
last
he
heard
the
voice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

The

was
obliged
to
make
as

awake
as

had
done
to
go
to
sleep
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
him
so
pale
and
fatigued
that
he
inquired
whether
he
was
ill
.
'T
is
your

you
simpleton

''
answered
the
duke
.
Never
commit
such
an

``

Ah

You

The

meanwhile
recovered
his
self-control
.
``
My

remember

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
sign
which
meant
that
he
did
n't
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
him

The
duke
tried
to
exchange
a
glance
with

,
but
there
was
no
glance
in

``

on

``

the

They
stopped
at
the
sign

the

in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a

known
for
many

by

asked

``

``

replied
the

smiling

When

reappeared
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
received
him
with
the

paternal

as
that

he
had
often
bestowed

a

<PROPER_NOUN>

He
entered
the
hotel
and
ascended
the
front
steps
,
and
addressing
a
footman
who
waited
there
in
a
grand
livery
,
asked
if
the

opened

She
had
still
her

so
that
when

was

she
still
was
not

At

she
raised

a

peeped
out

with
some
curiosity

<UNK>
lace
adorned
the
falling
collar
of
his

and
lace
fell
also
over
the
top
of
his

passed

descended
in
a
slow

solemn
manner

stood
with

uncovered
before
these

was
not

Meanwhile

passing
on
for

as

for
those
who
were
preparing
his

only
for

it
passed

It

his

from

and
his

laughing

drinking

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
still
the

therefore
he
retained
the

more

at

a

weakness

All
this

set
off
by
the

invented

a

When

arrived
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
carelessly
and
sat
down
by
a

in

letting
his

<UNK>

The

in

then
took
from

opened

both

down

Now

<PROPER_NOUN>
then

his

it
was
<NUMBER>

The

a

of

had
recognized

his

and
very

all
those

served

were
placed
in

waiting

before
quitting

said
in

whisper
:

Comminges
knocked
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
waiting
behind
<PROPER_NOUN>
until
the

At

having

the

learned
that

at

Still
,
in

this

politeness
,
the
countenances

betrayed
a

uneasiness

<PROPER_NOUN>
became
very

and
waited
impatiently
for

to
explain
himself
.
``
I

she
began

clinging

window
:

Comminges
seized
the

around

waist

would
have
dragged

from

post
;

at
that
instant
a

voice

proceeding
from

was
heard
<UNK>
:

The

began

increase

assembled
from

invaded
the
space

had
till

kept
clear
between

He
leaped
from

placed
his

against
the
<UNK>
of
the
carriage
,
making
a
rampart
of
his
horse
,
drew
his
pistols
from
their
holsters
and
fastened
them
to
his
belt
,
and
began
to
fight
with
the
back
sword
,
like
a
man
accustomed
to
the
handling

his

``
In

so
to

threw

sprang
in
after

From

a

flashed
among
the

down

some

were

the
echo

All

about

at

a

at

opened

upset

trodden
down

and
an

,
striking

cutting
right

rushed
up
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
took
him
in
his

just
as
he
was
about

fall

And
he
turned
around

with

<UNK>
back
on

concluded

saying

placed

bowed

a
glance
as

he

The

continued
the

Those

stopped

The

The

was

was
wont
to
hesitate
at
nothing
;

he
had
that
lofty
contempt
for
the
populace
which
army
officers
usually
profess

This

the
marshal
charged
,
but
he
was
welcomed
by
musket
shots
,
while
stones
fell
like
hail
from
all
the
windows
.
The
marshal
then
entered
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
there
he
was
opposed

dismounted

The

overwhelmed

with

iron

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

and
cloak

appeared

moving
tranquilly
in
the

the
fusillade

bestowing
his
benedictions
to
the

left
,
as
undisturbed
as

retreated

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
bowing

In

,
that

not
deserve

he
asked

And
so
they
descended
the
private
stair
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
leaning
on
the
arm
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
hand
the
musketeer
felt
trembling
.
The
steps
were
already
down
and
the
door
open
.
He
had
made
some
difficulties
about
going
,
under
pretext
that
he
still
suffered
from
his
wound
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
said
to
him
:
``
Remain

upon
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
declared

without
asking
anything
further

that
he
was
ready
to
follow
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
end

Before
him
,
on
the
front
seat
,
lay
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
of

<NUMBER>
in

of

``
A

they
cried

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>

But
putting
hid
head
out
of
the
carriage
:

Eh

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
is
it

''
``
Oh

uttered
a

groan

The
carriage
resumed
its
course
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
held
his
breath
,
ventured
to
breathe
again
.

he

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
coachman
raised
his
whip
.
``
I
will
pay

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
I

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Without
doubt
he
recognized
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
he
became
deadly
pale
;
doubtless
the
musketeer
knew
him
,
for
his
hair
stood
up
on
his
head
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
perhaps
about

reply

when
a
blow
,
similar

of

falling
on

an
ox

was
heard
.
cried
he
to
the
coachman

The
coachman
bestowed
a
heavy
blow
of
the
whip
upon
his
horses
;
the
noble
animals
bounded
forward
;
then
cries

men
who
were
knocked
down
were
heard
;
then
a
double
<UNK>
was
felt
,

<NUMBER>

seemed

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>

holding
out
his

took
and
shook
in
his

why

``
It
was
an

He
was
approached
to
be
examined
,
and
when
it
was
discovered
by
his
<UNK>
hat
and
his
laced
coat
,
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
musketeers

he
was
surrounded

with

The
porter
at
the
palace
was
about
to
close
the
gates
,
but
seeing
such
a
handsome
equipage
he
fancied
that
it
was
some
visit
of
importance
and
the
carriage
was
allowed
to
pass
and
to
stop
beneath
the
porch
.
The
coachman
perceived
at
once
,
by
the
expression
of
the
man
who
thus
addressed
him
,
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
trap
,
and
he
remained
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
<UNK>
staring
.
Then
turning
toward
the
second
musketeer
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

The
musketeer
signified
by
a
nod
that
these
commands
should
be
obeyed
to
the
letter
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
out

followed
by

``
Go

the

the

she
supped

The
queen
then
began
to
read

and
after
conversing
with

affectionately
for
a

,
dismissed

She

The

entered

She

bowed

The

entered

D'Artagnan
remained
at

It

of

when

reappeared

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
from
the
expression

that
she
was
about

Where

``
Without

she
murmured
.
``
But

The
young
king
approached
his

and
said
,
``
Why
do
as
these
people
ask

''
``

<PROPER_NOUN>

In

at

all
at

it
ceased

On

stopped
short

respectfully

the

A

wrapped

in

hidden

approached

leaned
over

The
queen
appeared

was
followed
by

The

uttered

the

their

On

offered

accepted

went
from

left

seeing
that
it

empty

she
said

he
did

On
the

our

had
landed
at

and

in
<NUMBER>
parties

had
set
out
for

On
reaching
the
capital
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
it
in

``
And
where

``
Ah

every

be
going

``
Ah

``
Enter
the

said
the

;
``
we
will
lay
your

The

long
cloaks
,
in
whose

they
were
carefully
enveloped
;
<NUMBER>
of
them
,
shorter
than

remained

in

On
hearing
these

the

the

men
seemed
more
attentive
than
ever
to
what
was
going
on

wrapping

more
carefully

asked

At
this

the
sergeant
,
who
had
been
for
his
orders

returned
,
and
pointing
to
the
<NUMBER>
gentlemen
in
cloaks
,
said
:
``
The

asked
the

The

burst
into

``

smiled
on
seeing
what

was
held
in
the

by
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

But
then

asked

``

He

Then
turning
to
his

:

Allow

he
said

The

rode
rapidly
down
the
declivity
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
on
arriving
at
the
bottom
were
surprised
to
find
that
the

become

went

murmured

opening

Whether
he
spoke
seriously
or
in
jest
,
since
it
was
evident
that
under
existing
circumstances
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the
only
man
who
could
relieve
the
queen

uneasiness

without

to
announce
to

this

and
as
he
had
foreseen
,
the

gave
orders
to
introduce

at
once
.
The
queen
,
as
he
went
on
,
looked
at
him
with
increasing
astonishment
.
``
Pardon
,
madame

but
I
think
that
either
I
have
expressed
myself
badly

your

Now
,
that
an
explanation
may
bear
fruit
,
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
quietly
conducted

far
from
noise
and
interruption

We
were
able
to
prove
the
contrary
,
and
that
proof
we
are
ready
to
give
to
your

calling
in
support
of
it
the

Before
he
could
be
possibly
set
free
the

would
be
dead

indeed

so

fixing
upon

with
that

Here
was
another

from

broken
