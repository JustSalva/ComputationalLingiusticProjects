This

he
stoutly

Only
a

after

an

But
when

that

The

expected

This

against

was

There

And
was
not
this
a
sweet
triumph
for
the
burghers
of
the

whose
envy
even
beat
that

Some

Amid

The
noise
which
had
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
suppose
that

were
forcing

was
indeed
owing

the

against

he

leaned
out

He

And
whilst

the

the

The

alluded
to
had

for
its

those

we
left
looking

on

In

At

the

Only

Some

seized

by

dragged
him
into
the

,
into
the
middle
of
which

he
was

in

restrained
the
glance

gloomy
malice
which
glistened
in
his

eye

and
answered

He

who
,
with

had
reached

But
the

There
remained

a

fired
a

with

and
this

the

took

blowing

Then
came
the

As

to
make
up

he
hastened
to
open
the

swung
creaking
on

taking
from

a

he
sounded

on

an

speedily
made

leading
another

convinced

just
enough

began
by

To

the

,
however

he
did
not
appear
in
the

who
deserved
to
be
hung

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
truly
beloved
by

nor
had

any

He
had
therefore
,
with
great
care
and
patience
,
and
by
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
exertions
,
laid
out
near
his
house
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
garden
fit
for
the
culture
of
his
cherished
flower
;
he
had
mixed
the
soil
according
to
the
most
approved
<UNK>
,
and
given
to
his
<UNK>
just
as
much
heat
and
fresh
air
as
the
strictest
rules
of
horticulture
exact
.
They
were
beautiful
,
nay
,
distinguished
.
All
at
once
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
after
all
his
learned
pursuits
,
had
been
seized
with
the

made
some
changes
in
his
house
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
,
as
we
have
stated

was
next
door
to
that

The

he
thought

had
raised
his

to
get
better
light

thus
far
he
had
only
been
in

He
therefore
felt
almost
grateful
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
having
given
him
a
screen
gratis
.
What
was
the
agony
of
the
unfortunate
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
seeing
the
windows
of
the
new
story
set
out
with
bulbs
and
seedlings
of
tulips
for
the
border
,
and
tulips
in
<UNK>
;
in
short
,
with
everything
<UNK>
to
the
pursuits
of
a
<UNK>

He
studied
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
all
her
aspects
for
the
benefit
of
his
paintings
,
which
were
as
<UNK>
finished
as
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his
master
,
and
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

his
friend

Besides
this
,
sufficient
shade
to
temper
the

heat
;
aspect
<UNK>
;
water
in
abundant
supply
,
and
at
hand
;
in
short
,
every
<UNK>
to
insure
not
only
success
but
also
progress
.
And
thus
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
painted
tulips
,
but
for
real
ones
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
from
him
half
a
degree
of
warmth
.
And
now
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
produced
a

tulip
,

named
it
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

after
having
named
<NUMBER>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
From
that
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
interest
in
tulips
was
no
longer
a
<UNK>
to
his
exertions
,
but
a
<UNK>
anxiety
.
He
belonged
to
that
natural

<UNK>
school
who
took
for
their
motto
in
the
<UNK>
century
the
<UNK>
uttered
by
<NUMBER>
of
their
number
in
<NUMBER>
,
-
``
To
despise
flowers
is
to
offend

''
``
Therefore
,
he
who
despises
the
tulip

<PROPER_NOUN>
beyond
measure
.
''
<UNK>
,
heart
and
soul
,
in
his
pursuits
of
sowing
,
planting
,
and
gathering
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
caressed
by
the
whole
<UNK>
of
tulip-growers
in
<PROPER_NOUN>

entertained
nor
the
least
suspicion
that
there
was
at
his
very
door
a
<UNK>
whose
throne
he
had
usurped
.
When
the
evil
spirit
has
once
taken
hold
of
the
heart
of
man
,
it
urges
him
on
,
without
letting
him
stop
.
How
often
had
the
miserable
,
jealous
man
to
observe
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
beds
tulips
which
dazzled
him
by
their
beauty
,
and
almost
choked
him
by
their
perfection
!
Yet
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
such
progress
in
the
noble
science
of
growing
tulips
,
which
he
seemed
to
master
with
the
true
instinct
of
genius
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
last
was
maddened
to
such
a
degree
as
to
think
of
throwing
stones
and
sticks
into
the
<UNK>
of
his
neighbour
.
The
frightened
cats
,
having
alighted
on
the
ground
,
first
tried
to
fly
each
in
a
different
direction
,
until
the
string
by
which
they
were
tied
together
was
tightly
stretched
across
the
bed
;
then
,
however
,
feeling
that
they
were
not
able
to
get
off
,
they
began
to
pull
to
and
fro
,
and
to
wheel
about
with
hideous
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
down
with
their
string
the
flowers
among
which
they
were
struggling
,
until
,
after
a
furious
strife
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
the
string
broke
and
the
combatants
vanished
.
The
<UNK>
of
his
rival
was
to
pay
for
all
the
inconvenience
which
he
incurred
himself
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
trembled
with
joy
.
Not
<NUMBER>
of
the
<NUMBER>
tulips
which
the
latter
had
meant
to
destroy
was
injured
at
all
.
On
making
inquiries
,
he
learned
that
the
whole
night
had
been
disturbed
by
terrible
<UNK>
.
It
was
,
therefore
,
generally
said
that
the
<UNK>
of
the
prize
might
just
as
well
have
offered
<NUMBER>
millions
as
a
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
guilders
,
since
no
one
would
be
able
to
gain
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
soon
as
the
idea
had
once
taken
root
in
his
clear
and
ingenious
mind
,
began
slowly
the
necessary
planting
and
<UNK>
to
reduce
the
tulips
which
he
had
grown
already
from
red
to
brown
,
and
from
brown
to
dark
brown
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
once
more
<UNK>
by
the
superiority
of
his
hated
rival
,
was
now
completely
disgusted
with
tulip-growing
,
and
,
being
driven
half
mad
,
devoted
himself
entirely
to
observation
.
But
the
most
curious
part
of
the
operations
was
not
performed
in
the
garden
.
This
innocent
magic
,
the
fruit
at
the
same
time
of
<UNK>
musings
and
of
manly
genius
-
this
patient
<UNK>
labour
,
of
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
himself
to
be
incapable
-
made
him
,
gnawed
as
he
was
with
envy
,
centre
all
his
life
,
all
his
thoughts
,
and
all
his
hopes
in
his
telescope
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
having
attended
to
his
family
affairs
,
reached
the
house
of
his
godson
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
evening
in
the
month
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
.
He
inquired
what
it
meant
,
and
,
on
being
informed
of
the
cause
of
all
this
stir
,
climbed
up
to
his
post
of
observation
,
where
in
spite
of
the
cold
,
he
took
his
stand
,
with
the
telescope
to
his
eye
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
passed
the
whole
winter
in
his
laboratory
,
in
the
midst
of
his
books
and
pictures
.
The
dry-room
,
this
<UNK>
,
this
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
the
tulip-fancier
,
was
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
old
,
interdicted
to
the
profane
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
taking
the
candlestick
from
the
hands
of
the
foremost
,
conducted
his
godfather
into
that
room
,
which
was
no
other
than
that
very
cabinet
with
a
glass
front
into
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
continually
prying
with
his
telescope
.
<NUMBER>
of
them
,
tall
,
majestic
,
stern
,
sat
down
near
the
table
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
placed
the
taper
.
He
therefore
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
parcel
contained
simply
some
papers
,
and
that
these
papers
were
relating
to
politics
.
But
,
on
the
contrary
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
received
the
parcel
from
the
hands
of
his
godfather
with
every
mark
of
respect
,
and
put
it
by
with
the
same
respectful
manner
in
a
drawer
,
<UNK>
it
away
so
that
it
should
not
take
up
too
much
of
the
room
which
was
reserved
to
his
bulbs
.
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
we
have
seen
,
locked
it
up
with
his
most
precious
bulbs
,
to
think
no
more
of
it
,
after
his
godfather
had
left
him
;
very
unlike
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
looked
upon
this
parcel
as
a
clever
pilot
does
on
the
distant
and
scarcely
perceptible
cloud
which
is
increasing
on
its
way
and
which
is
fraught
with
a
storm
.
``
I
shall
find
the

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself
,
whilst
<UNK>

It
is
therefore
settled

give
the

It
will
cause

to
no

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
continued
in
his
soliloquy
,
``

Suddenly
the
bell
of
his
cabinet
was
rung
much
more
violently
than
usual
.
``

answered
the
servant
,
``

And
at

forcing

At

,
still
on
his
knees
,
was
examining
his
<UNK>

the
door

was
so
violently
shaken

and
opened
in
such
a

manner

that
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
rising
in
his
cheeks

his
ears
the
glow
of
that
evil
<UNK>
which
is
called
wrath

cried
the
servant
,
rushing
into
the
dry-room
with
a
much
paler
face
and
with
a
much
more
frightened
mien
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
shown
.

quick

``

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

``

At
this
moment
they
saw
across
the
banister
of
the
staircase
the
points
of
the
halberds
of
the
soldiers
rising
.
At
this
very
moment
the
soldiers
,
preceded
by
a
magistrate
,
entered
the
room
.
``
Then
give
up
to
us

The
magistrate
turned
round
and
took
a
rapid
survey
of
the
whole
cabinet
.
The
magistrate
cast
a
glance
at
a
small
note
at
the
top
of
his
papers
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

said
the

,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

when
he
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
standing
immovable

bewildered

``
Do

answered
the

cried
the
Doctor

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but
what
have
I
done
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
mute
stupefaction
,
embraced
his
old
nurse
,
who
was
in
a
swoon
;
shook
hands
with
his
servants
,
who
were
bathed
in
tears
,
and
followed
the
magistrate

who
put
him
in
a
coach

a
prisoner

state

had
him
driven
at
full
gallop

The
<UNK>
of
all
this
was
that
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
watched
the
course
of
political
events
much
more
attentively
than
his
neighbour
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
used

heard
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

would
be
arrested

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
quite
aware
of
the
progress
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
made
towards
producing
the
grand
black
tulip
.
Now
in
that
night
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
climb
over
the
wall
and
,
as
he
knew
the
position
of
the
bulb
which
was
to
produce
the
grand
black
tulip
,
he
would
<UNK>
it
;
and
instead
of
flowering
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
would
flower
for
him
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
also
,
instead
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

would
have
the
prize

<NUMBER>
guilders
,
not
to
speak
of
the
sublime
honour
of
calling
the
new
flower
Tulipa
nigra
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
a
result
which
would
satisfy
not
only
his
vengeance
,
but
also
his
cupidity
and
his
ambition
.
Never
did
a
<UNK>
paper
,
slipped
into
the
jaws
of
the
bronze
lions
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
produce
a
more
prompt
and
terrible
effect
.
He
knew
too
well
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
house
of
the
poor
doctor
to
feel
any
desire
to
look
into
it
.
His
servant
entered
the
room
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
hid
himself
under
the
<UNK>
.
``
How
can
I
know
it

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
muttered
,
with
a
faltering
voice
;
``
the

impossible

Be

said
the

to
himself

whilst
leaving
the

,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
must
be
very

such
good

''
It
was
the
night
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
looked
forward
to
.
He
heard
the
clock
strike
-
<NUMBER>
,
eleven
,
<NUMBER>
.
Then
,
knowing
to
an
inch
where
the
bulbs
which
were
to
produce
the
black
tulip
were
planted
,
he
ran
towards
the
spot
,
following
,
however
,
the
<UNK>
walks
in
order
not
to
be
betrayed
by
his
footprints
,
and
,
on
arriving
at
the
precise
spot
,
he
proceeded
,
with
the
eagerness
of
a
tiger
,
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
soft
ground
.
He
felt
about
on
the
right
,
and
on
the
left
,
-
nothing
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
the
place
.
All
at
once
,
a
last
ray
of
hope
presented
itself
to
his
mind
:
the
<UNK>
bulbs
might
be
in
the
dry-room
;
it
was
therefore
only
requisite
to
make
his
entry
there
as
he
had
done
into
the
garden
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
noticed
in
the
street
where
he
lived
a
house
which
was
being
repaired
,
and
against
which
a
very
tall
ladder
was
placed
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
put
a
lighted
dark
lantern
into
his
pocket
,
mounted
the
ladder
,
and
slipped
into
the
dry-room
.
But
in
vain
did
he
search
the
whole
room
,
open
and
shut
all
the
drawers
,
even
that
privileged
<NUMBER>
where
the
parcel
which
had
been
so
fatal
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
deposited
;
he
found
ticketed
,
as
in
a
<UNK>
garden
,
the
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
the
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
the
hazel-nut
,
and
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
tulip
;
but
of
the
black
tulip
,
or
rather
the
<UNK>
bulbs
within
which
it
was
still
sleeping
,
not
a
trace
was
found
.
Then
,
suddenly
striking
his
forehead
in
his
frenzy
,
he
called
out
,
``
Oh
wretch
that
I
am
!
Could
<NUMBER>
live
far
from
<NUMBER>

bulbs
,
when
they
enclose
the

black
tulip
?
``
Well
,
then
,
after
all
,
''
said
the
envious
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
raising
his
livid
face
from
his
hands
in
which
it
had
been
buried
-
``
if
he
has
them
,
he
can
keep
them
only
as
long
as
he
lives
,
and
-
-
''
The
rest
of
this
detestable
thought
was
expressed
by
a
hideous
smile
.
It
was
about
midnight
when
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
locked
up
in
the
prison
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
A
momentary
<UNK>
had
therefore
set
in
whilst
the
prison
was
empty
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
availed
herself
of
this
favourable
moment
to
come
forth
from
her
hiding
place
,
which
she
also
induced
her
father
to
leave
.
They
went
to
close
the
great
gate
,
at
least
as
well
as
it
would
close
,
considering
that
it
was
half
demolished
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
hid
herself
this
time
also
,
but
only
that
she
might
not
see
the
ghastly
spectacle
.
And
quite
enchanted
with
his
joke
,
the
ferocious
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
his
<UNK>
and
his
keys
to
conduct
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
cell

which
on
that
very
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
to
go
into
exile

or
what
in
revolutionary
times
is
meant
instead
by
those
sublime
philosophers
who
lay
it
down
as
an
axiom
of
high
policy
,
``
It
is
the
dead
only

return

''
It
would
have
made
a
fine
picture
,
worthy
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
gloomy
winding
stairs
illuminated
by
the
reddish
glare
of
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
his
<UNK>
jailer
's
countenance
at
the
top
,
the
melancholy
figure
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
bending
over
the
banister
to
look
down
upon
the
sweet
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
standing
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
bright
frame
of
the
door
of
her
chamber
,
with
embarrassed
mien
at
being
thus
seen
by
a
stranger
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
then
proceeded
on
his
way
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
forced
to
follow
him
,
and
<NUMBER>
minutes
afterwards
he
entered
his
prison
,
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
,
as
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
it
.
Now
and
then
during
the
night
horses
had
galloped
at
a
smart
pace
over
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
patrols
had
resounded
from
the
pavement
,
and
the
slow
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
in
the
east
wind
,
had
thrown
up
at
intervals
a
sudden
glare
as
far
as
to
the
panes
of
his
window
.
The
good
people
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
<UNK>
off
the
flesh
of
its
victims
,
but
faithfully
carried
the
remainder
to
the
gibbet
,
to
have
a
pretext
for
a
double
inscription
written
on
a
huge
<UNK>
,
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
with
the
keen
sight
of
a
young
man
of
<NUMBER>
,
was
able
to
read
the
following
lines
,
<UNK>
by
the
coarse
brush
of
a
<UNK>
:
-
``
Here

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
his

<NUMBER>

but
great
friends

.
''
``
Master
,
master
,
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
seizing
the
jailer
by
the
arm
and
dragging
him
towards
the
window
,
-
``
master
,
what
have
I
read
down
there
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
broke
out
into
a
laugh
.
Well
,
my
good
sir
,
that
's
what
people
will
get
for
corresponding
with
the
enemies
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
well
,
I
call
it
executed
.
''
Then
turning
again
to
the
concerns
of
earth
,
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
he
was
alone
in
his
dungeon
,
he
drew
from
his
breast
the
<NUMBER>
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
,
and
concealed
them
behind
a
block
of
stone
,
on
which
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
of
the
prison
was
standing
,
in
the
darkest
corner
of
his
cell
.
At
this
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
fell
into
a
gloomy
despair
,
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
an
extraordinary
circumstance
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
forward
towards
the
jailer
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
serious
nature
of
his
injury
,
called
out
to
him
,
-
``
It
is
nothing
:
do
n't
you
stir
.
''
But
the
thought
never
entered
his
mind
of
profiting
by
this
accident
;
he
had
seen
from
the
manner
in
which
the
arm
was
bent
,
and
from
the
noise
it
made
in
bending
,
that
the
bone
was
<UNK>
,
and
that
the
patient
must
be
in
great
pain
;
and
now
he
thought
of
nothing
else
but
of
administering
relief
to
the
sufferer
,
however
little
benevolent
the
man
had
shown
himself
during
their
short
interview
.
But
<NUMBER>
moment
told
her
the
true
state
of
the
case
and
,
ashamed
of
her
first
thoughts
,
she
cast
her
beautiful
eyes
,
wet
with
tears
,
on
the
young
man
,
and
said
to
him
,
-
``
I
beg
your

thank
you

the

this
is
more
than

this
is
indeed
Christian
charity

''
``
Hush

my

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
sat
down
;
then
,
turning
towards
his

he
said

``
Well

did
n't
you
hear
?
``
Is
this
what
you

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
pushed
the
table

<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
the
broken

on
it
so
as
to
make
it
flat

with
perfect
skill
set
the

adjusted

fastened
the

``
What

``
Look

``
And

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
the

said
the
young
girl
,
with
some
impatience
.
``
You
are
very
good

my

child

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

For

do

Take

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
``
My

,
I
am
innocent
,
and
I
shall
await
my
trial

tranquillity

``
What

that

''
``
Now

what

there
together
about

''
Well

my

girl
,
I
shall
put
you
on
diet
too

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
exchanged
glances
.
The
examination
,
however
,
did
not
last
long
,
it
having
appeared
on
evidence
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
kept
at
his
house
that
fatal
correspondence
of
the
brothers
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
confession
involved
the
godson
in
the
crime
of
the
godfather
;
manifest
complicity
being
considered
to
exist
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
To
this
it
was
objected
,
that
in
this
respect
he
could
not
possibly
be
speaking
the
truth
,
since
the
papers
had
been
deposited
in
a
press
in
which
both
his
hands
and
his
eyes
must
have
been
engaged
every
day
.
To
this
it
was
objected
that
,
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
wished
to
act
in
such
a
way
,
he
would
have
added
to
the
parcel
,
in
case
of
accidents
,
a
certificate
setting
forth
that
his
godson
was
an
entire
stranger
to
the
nature
of
this
correspondence
,
or
at
least
he
would
during
his
trial
have
written
a
letter
to
him
,
which
might
be
produced
as
his
justification
.
The
paper
also
was
not
very
likely
to
be
found
,
and
no
one
gave
himself
the
trouble
to
look
for
it
.
Hear
it
.
They
considered
that
every
<UNK>
of
civil
<UNK>
is
mischievous
,
because
it
<UNK>
the
contest
which
it
is
the
interest
of
all
to
put
down
.
And
<UNK>
lies
the
<UNK>
of
the
case

A
<UNK>
clause
was
tacked
to
the
sentence
,
to
the
effect
that
``
the

executioner
would
cut

his

His
keys
passed
into
the
hands
of
<NUMBER>
of
his
assistants
.
``
Indeed
,
I
have
not

''
he
replied
.
``
Why

to-day

''
answered
the
Recorder
,
a
little
surprised
by
the
self-possession
of
the
condemned
man
.
``
Indeed

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

saw
nothing
but
the
golden
brocade
cap

with
lace

such

heard
nothing

extending

partly
towards

partly
towards

``

she
said

``

``
Yes

yes

make

he
said
,
``
you

The
poor

was
nearly
choking
with
her
sobs

flower

heaved
a

``
So

she
answered

``

asked
the

with
a
melancholy

afflicted

``

,
frightened
at

amidst

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
wringing
her

.
Do

<PROPER_NOUN>

''
The
noise
on
the
staircase
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
heard
was
caused
by
the
Recorder
,
who
was
coming
for
the
prisoner
.
When
the
moment
came
to
descend
in
order
to
follow
the
guards
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
sought
with
his
eyes
the
angelic
look
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
he
saw
,
behind
the
swords
and
halberds
,
only
a
form
lying
outstretched
near
a
wooden
bench
,
and
a
deathlike
face
half
covered
with
long
golden
locks
.
At
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
the
dog
quietly
looked
at
him
whilst
he
was
passing
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
even
fancied
he
saw
in
the
eyes
of

a
certain
expression
as

were
of
compassion

And
scarcely
had
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
his
appearance
than
a
fierce
groan
ran
through
the
whole
street
,
spreading
all
over
the
yard
,
and
<UNK>
from
the
streets
which
led
to
the
scaffold
,
and
which
were
likewise
crowded
with
spectators
.
Neither
of
his
enemies
,
nor
of
his
judges
,
nor
of
his
executioners
.
Yet
,
notwithstanding
all
this
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
mounted
the
scaffold
not
the
less
resolutely
,
proud
of
having
been
the
friend
of
that
illustrious
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
godson
of
that
noble
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
the

,
who
were
now
crowding
to
witness
his
own
doom
,
had
torn
to
pieces
and
burnt
<NUMBER>
days
before
.
A
gleam
like
that
of
lightning
passed
across
the
scaffold
:
it
was
the
executioner
raising
his
sword
.
He
saw
no
change
in
the
colour
of
the
sky
,
or
of
the
world
around
him
.
And
the
same
sun
,
yellow
and
pale
,
as
it
<UNK>
a
Dutch
sun
to

was
shining
in
the

the

grated
window
looked
down
upon
him
from

and
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
at

hoped

and
that
he
would
be
restored

liberty
and
to
his
flower
borders
at

He
was
not
sufficiently
guilty
to
suffer
death
,
but
he
was
too
much
so
to
be
set
at
liberty
.
also
very
far
from
it
;
for
Loewestein
,
as
the
<UNK>
tell
us
,
is
situated
at
the
point
of
the
islet
which
is
formed
by
the
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
opposite
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
suddenly
a
terrible
thought
struck
him
.
Whilst
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
engaged
with
his
own
thoughts
,
a
coach
had
driven
up
to
the
scaffold
.
He
hoped
to
see
at
the
window
the
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
up
again
.
Many
had
shown
themselves
eager
to
see
the
perfidious
blood
of
the
guilty
<UNK>
flow
,
but
not
<NUMBER>
had
shown
such
a
keen
anxiety
as
the
individual
just
alluded
to
.
This
burgher
was
no
other
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
since
the
arrest
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
come
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
try
if
he
could
not
get
hold
of
the
<NUMBER>
bulbs
of
the
black
tulip
.
The
piece
which
the
<UNK>
had
torn
from
his
hose
did
not
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
the
meanwhile
the
sentence
had
been
pronounced
.
But
there
were
<NUMBER>
things
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
calculate
upon
:
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
is
to
say
,
love
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
is
to

,
clemency
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
to
the
headsman
,
to
whom
he
gave
himself
out
as
a
great
friend
of
the
condemned
man
;
and
from
whom
he
bought
all
the
clothes
of
the
dead
man
that
was
to
be
,
for
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
guilders
;
rather
an
<UNK>
sum
,
as
he
engaged
to
leave
all
the
<UNK>
of
gold
and
silver
to
the
executioner
.
He
needed
only
,
as
soon
as
the
execution
was
over
,
to
allow
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
ascend
the
scaffold
with
his
servants
,
to
remove
the
inanimate
remains
of
his
friend
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
like
the
people
who
enter
a
show
at
a
fair
,
might
be
disappointed
,
and
refuse
to
pay
on
going
out
.
how
would
he
fall
?
Why
did
that
stupid
executioner
thus
lose
time
in
brandishing
his
sword
over
the
head
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
instead
of
cutting
that
head
off
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
quite
overcome
by
his
frenzy
,
fell
from
the
stone
upon
some
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
like
him
,
were
<UNK>
vexed
at
the
turn
which
affairs
had
taken
.
But
in
his
hurry
he
overlooked
a
<UNK>
in
his
way
,
stumbled
,
lost
his
centre
of
gravity
,
rolled
over
to
a
distance
of
some
yards
,
and
only
rose
again
,
bruised
and
<UNK>
,
after
the
whole
rabble
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
their
muddy
feet
,
had
passed
over
him
.
As
chance
would
have
it
,
the
cell
formerly
inhabited
by
the
illustrious
<UNK>
happened
to
be
vacant
,
when
the
clemency
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
sent
the
tulip-fancier
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
there
.
We
will
only
state
here
that
,
with
the
exception
of
an
alcove
which
was
contrived
there
for
the
use
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
<UNK>
in
no
respect
from
the
other
cells
of
the
prison
;
only
,
perhaps
,
it
was
a
little
higher
,
and
had
a
splendid
view
from
the
grated
window
.
Fortunately
the
good
doctor
was
mistaken
.
By
fastening
a
little
note
to
the
wing
of
<NUMBER>
of
these
pigeons
,
one
might
have
a
chance
to
send
a
message
there
.
It
cost
him
<NUMBER>
more
months
to
catch
a
<UNK>
bird
;
he
then
shut
them
up
together
,
and
having
about
the
beginning
of
the
year
<NUMBER>
obtained
some
eggs
from
them
,
he
released
the
female
,
which
,
leaving
the
<UNK>
behind
to
<UNK>
the
eggs
in
her
stead
,
flew
joyously
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
the
note
under
her
wing
.
On
the
sixteenth
day
,
at
last
,
she
came
back
without
it
.
Leaving
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
abandoned
,
not
only
his
house
,
his
servants
,
his
<UNK>
,
and
his
telescope
,
but
also
his
pigeons
.
She
conceived
an
affection
for
the
pigeons
which
had
thrown
themselves
on
her
hospitality
;
and
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
servant
<UNK>
them
with
<UNK>
intentions
,
having
eaten
the
first
<UNK>
already
,
and
now
wishing
to
eat
the
other
<NUMBER>
,
she
offered
to
buy
them
from
him
for
a
consideration
of
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
per
head
.
Therefore
,
if
the
envious
wretch
had
not
left
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
follow
his
rival
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
first
place
,
and
then
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
or
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
for
the
<NUMBER>
places
are
separated
only
by
the
<UNK>
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
letter
would
have
fallen
into
his
hands
and
not
the
nurse
's
:
in
which
event
the
poor
prisoner
,
like
the
raven
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
,
would
have
thrown
away
his
time
,
his
trouble
,
and
,
instead
of
having
to
relate
the
series
of
exciting
events
which
are
about
to
flow
from
beneath
our
pen
like
the
varied
hues
of
a
many
<UNK>
tapestry
,
we
should
have
naught
to
describe
but
a
weary
waste
of
days
,
dull
and
melancholy
and
gloomy
as
night
's
dark
mantle
.
It
was
the
sweet
harmonious
voice
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
question
now
was
,
whether
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
made
the
journey
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
who
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
understand
how
-
had
succeeded
even
in
penetrating
into
the
prison
,
would
also
be
fortunate
enough
in
penetrating
to
the
prisoner
himself
.
``

The

I
could
not

which
your

I
hastened
to

there
I
remained
until

should
come

and
when

came

I
asked
him

the

by

by
the

the

left
their

quite

<PROPER_NOUN>
put
his

out

examine
the

Rather

expose

he
drove
away
for

The

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
will
be
the

your

only
confirmed
me
the

in

And
,
saying
these

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
so
exceedingly
pretty

that
for

<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
his

with
a
look
beaming
with

Yet
,
in

this

they
communicated
to
the
lips

the
glowing

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fled
so
precipitately

that
she
completely
forgot
to

the

To
him

had
swelled

In

to
engage
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
a
conversation
from
the
very
first
which
would
seriously
occupy

she
tendered
to
him
through
the

the

attention

you

<PROPER_NOUN>
withdrew

Then

at

he
planted

had
made

smiling

<PROPER_NOUN>

quietly

<PROPER_NOUN>
tried

The

passed

exasperated

plunged

she
fled

We

to
the
disgrace

that

when

at

<NUMBER>
in

he
fell

the

yielded

During

the
poor

did
not
close
an

,
and
before

rose
in
the

she
had
come
to
the
resolution

no

she
muttered

when
perusing
again
this

which
she
never
finished
without
a

the

love

rolling
from
her
limpid
eyes
on
her
pale
cheeks

``
alas

Never
had
the

at

arrived

when
in
the
contest
between
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
the

had
had

yield

She
had
not
forgotten

whose

she
<UNK>
in
her

,
even
when

did

This

took
more
and
more
hold

until
at

his

was
absorbed
in

The
noise

the

mounted

than
he
used

to
himself

his

had
not
deceived
him

<PROPER_NOUN>

being

shut

And
yet
he

passed
the

in

which

point

allowed

the

He

lit
in

whilst
with

They
had
never
been
so
near
the
destruction
of
their
hopes
as
at
this
moment
,
when
they
thought
themselves
certain
of
their
fulfilment
.
Besides
thus
offering
a
bait
to
the
ambition
of
the
father
,
he
managed
,
at
the

time
,
to
interest
his

<UNK>
to
him
in

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
in

,
and
who
,
as
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
it
,
was
in

with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
to
the
<UNK>
of
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
that
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<UNK>
was
the
more
fierce
,
as
,
though
suspecting
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
possessed
a
second
bulb
,
he
by
no
means
felt
sure
of
it

<UNK>
in
by
the
stratagem
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
feigned
to
put
it
in
the

,
and
entertaining
no
doubt
that
this
little

had
been
played
in
order
to
force
him

betray
himself
,
he
redoubled
his
precaution
,
and
employed
every
means
suggested
by
his
crafty
nature
to
watch
the
others
without
being
watched
himself
.
He
had
not
been
installed
more
than
<NUMBER>
days
in
his

before
all
his
doubts
were
removed
.
When
the
nights
threatened
to
be
too
cold
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
in
the
flower-pot
.
But
when
the
first
leaves
peeped
out
of
the
earth
Boxtel
was
fully
convinced
;
and
his
telescope
left
him
no
longer
in
any
uncertainty
before
they
had
grown
<NUMBER>
inch
in
height
.
Certainly
this
was
no
easy
task
.
This
happened
during
those
<NUMBER>
days
which
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
so
unhappy
,
depriving
him
at
the
same
time
of
all
news
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
of
his
tulip
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
yet
quite
decided
which
of
these
<NUMBER>
names
he
would
give
to
the
tulip
,
but
,
as
both
meant
the
same
thing
,
this
was
,
after
all
,
not
the
important
point
.
He
first
of
all
took
advantage
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
absence
to
make
himself
fully
acquainted
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
the
door
of
her
chamber
.
He
collected
as
many
keys
as
he
could
,
and
tried
all
of
them
during
<NUMBER>
of
those
delightful
hours
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
passed
together
at
the
grating
of
the
cell
.
It
cost
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
days
more
to
bring
his
key
to
perfection
,
with
the
aid
of
a
small
file
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
alone
with
the
tulip
.
He
therefore
-
as
being
in
possession
of
the
key
,
he
might
enter
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
chamber
whenever
he
liked
-
thought
it
better
to
wait
and
to
take
it
either
an
hour
before
or
after
opening
,
and
to
start
on
the
instant
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
the
tulip
would
be
before
the
judges
of
the
committee
before
any
<NUMBER>
else
could
put

a

On
the
evening
at
which

have
arrived
he
was
going
to
enter
according
to
custom
;
but
the
<NUMBER>
lovers
,
as
we
have
seen
,
only
exchanged
a
few
words
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
sent
<PROPER_NOUN>
back
to
watch
over
the
tulip

<PROPER_NOUN>
being
once
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
very
nearly
master
of
the
house
.
But
what
was
she
going
to
do
with
it
?
This
was
more
likely
.
By
the
light
of
the
dark
lantern
he
saw
the
tulip
open
,
and
black
as
the
night
in
which
he
was
hidden
.
<NUMBER>
minutes
after
,
he
saw
her
leave
the
room
again
,
and
lock
it
twice
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
standing
on
the
spot
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
him
.
Almost
at
the

instant
he
saw
before
him
the
pale
and
distracted
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

``

<PROPER_NOUN>

immovable

full

heard
almost
without

and
only

the
unfortunate

was
increased
<UNK>
by

began
to
shake

with

through

ascended

without

no

I

It

He
held
in

a

his

glistening
with

a

played
round

therefore

at

found

A

was
immediately
drawn
up

as
it
was

it

neither

Among

they
told

The

The

reminded

<PROPER_NOUN>
addressed

at

himself

clad

The

nearer

As
no

was
made
to
prevent
it
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
a

,
wearing
his

,
presented
himself
,
followed
by
<NUMBER>

a

``
If

the

He

knew

descended
the
staircase

The

heard
the

sounded

leaning
from

he
called
out

half
fainting

Meantime
the
subject

was
being

in

As

<PROPER_NOUN>
gazed
at

recollected
the

by

<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
how

lay

I

As

that

his

he

As

I
found

I
sent

said
the

took
his

He
sank
into

hastily
turning
over

drew
forth
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
waited

expecting

in

And
he
fixed
his

upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
if
he
would
have
penetrated
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
violent
effort

in

tone
he
strove

render
firm

-
``

said
he
,
``

And
after
having
assured
himself
that
the

gone
,
the
deputy
procureur
hastened
to
the
house
of
his
betrothed
.
After
<UNK>
windings
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
a
door
with
an
iron
wicket
.
He
was
conducted
to
a
tolerably
neat
chamber
,
but
grated
and
barred
,
and
its
appearance
,
therefore
,
did
not
greatly
alarm
him
;
besides
,
the
words
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
seemed
to
interest
himself
so
much
,
resounded
still
in
his
ears
like
a

of
freedom
.
At
last
,
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
and
just
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
despair
,
steps
were
heard
in
the
corridor
,
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
the
bolts
creaked
,
the
massy
oaken
door
flew
open
,
and
a
flood
of
light
from
<NUMBER>
torches
pervaded
the
apartment
.
asked
he
.
The
conviction
that
they
came
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
relieved
all
Dantes
'
apprehensions
;
he
advanced
calmly
,
and
placed
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
escort
.
``
It
is
for
you
,
''
replied
a
gendarme
.
Soon
he
saw
the
lights
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
officer
opened
the
door
,
which
was
locked
,
and
,
without
speaking
a
word
,
answered
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
question
;
for
he
saw
between
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
a
passage
formed
from
the
carriage
to
the
port
.
In
an
instant
he
was
placed
in
the
<UNK>
of
the
boat
,
between
the
gendarmes
,
while
the
officer
stationed
himself
at
the
bow
;
a
<UNK>
sent
the
boat
<UNK>
,
and
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
<UNK>
impelled
it
rapidly
towards
the

.
The
boat
continued
her
voyage
.
asked
he
.
The
most
vague
and
wild
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
.
Had
not
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
his
presence
destroyed
the
fatal
letter
,
the
only
proof
against
him
?
How
was
it
that
a
presentiment
did
not
warn
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
her
lover
was
within
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
yards
of
her
?
But
pride
restrained
him
and
he
did
not
utter
it
.
Dantes
turned
and
perceived
that
they
had
got
out
to
sea
.
The
gendarme
looked
<UNK>
at
his
companion
,
who
returned
for
answer
a
sign
that
said
,
``
I
see
no
great
harm
in
telling
him
now
,
''
and
the
gendarme
replied
,
-
``
You
are
a
native
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and

and
yet
you

going
?
''
``
That
is
impossible

''
``
Your

in

or
an

.
``
Look
round
you
then
.
''
cried
he
,
``
what
are
we
going
there
for

''
Are

any

''
``
You

he
,
``

taken

''
``
And
so
,
in

By
a
rapid
movement
,
which
the
gendarme
's
practiced
eye
had
perceived
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
forward
to
precipitate
himself
into
the
sea
;
but
<NUMBER>
vigorous
arms
seized
him
as
his
feet
quitted
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.

my
friend

I
have
<UNK>
my

I
will
blow
your

out

''
He
remained
motionless
,
but
<UNK>
his
teeth
and
wringing
his
hands
with
fury
.
Dantes
made
no
resistance
;
he
was
like
a
man
in
a
dream
:
he
saw
soldiers
drawn
up
on
the
<UNK>
;
he
knew
vaguely
that
he
was
ascending
a
flight
of
steps
;
he
was
conscious
that
he
passed
through
a
door
,
and
that
the
door
closed
behind
him
;
but
all
this
<UNK>
as
through
a
mist
.
They
waited
upwards
of
<NUMBER>
minutes
.
``
Where
is
the
prisoner
?
''
``
Go
!
''
``
It
is
late
,
and
the
governor
is
asleep
.
And
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
open
his
mouth
-
before
he
had
noticed
where
the
jailer
placed
his
bread
or
the
water
-
before
he
had
glanced
towards
the
corner
where
the
straw
was
,
the
jailer
disappeared
,
taking
with
him
the
lamp
and
closing
the
door
,
leaving
stamped
upon
the
prisoner
's
mind
the
dim
reflection
of
the
dripping
walls
of
his
dungeon
.
He
had
passed
the
night
standing
,
and
without
sleep

``
Have
you
not
slept
?
''
``
Are
you
hungry
?
''
``
I
wish
to
see

''
The
day
passed
thus
;
he
scarcely
tasted
food
,
but
walked
round
and
round
the
cell
like
a
wild
beast
in
its
cage
.
The
thought
was
<UNK>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
threw
himself
furiously
down
on
his
straw
.
``
Come
,
cheer
up
;
is
there
anything

``
Because

``
But

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
how

''
``
Ah

said
the

The

closed

<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
with
outstretched

touched
the
wall

he
then
sat
down
in

corner

accustomed

``

said
the

It
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who

hearing

had
come

abruptly

<PROPER_NOUN>

The

sacrificed
to
his

that

on

appeared
to

pale

threatening

leading

by

bringing

remorse

not

agony
whose

are
<UNK>
from

up

It

thus
that
a

As
the

had
promised

<PROPER_NOUN>
found
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
knew

sorrowfully

But
he
did
not
succeed

became

not

in

returned

``

on

passable

it

''
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
``
But
,
''
said
the

,
``
I
would
speak

<PROPER_NOUN>
fixed
his

on
him
with
an
expression
that

have
convinced

his

.
``
My

,
the

replied
the
inspector
;
``

Had
not

by

''
``
It
is
not
<UNK>

said
the

.
said
he
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

You

``
<UNK>

''
replied
the
governor
.
``
He
was

So
the
matter
ended
for
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
They
fear
the
ear
that
hears
their
orders
,
and
the
eye
that
<UNK>
their
actions
.
The
very
madness
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
gone
mad
in
prison
,
condemned
him
to
perpetual
captivity
.
The
inspector
could
not
contend
against
this
accusation
;
he
simply
wrote
,
-
``
Nothing
to
be
done
.
''
Finally
<NUMBER>
months
and
a
half
had
gone
by
and
no
favorable
change
had
taken
place
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
began
to
fancy
the
inspector
's
visit
but
a
dream
,
an
illusion
of
the
brain
.
This
horrible
place
contained
<NUMBER>
cells
;
their
inhabitants
were
designated
by
the
numbers
of
their
cell
,
and
the
unhappy
young
man
was
no
longer
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
he
was
now
number
<NUMBER>
.
<UNK>
,
who
ought
to
begin
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
do
not
have
any
hope
in
him
till
they
have
exhausted
all
other
means
of
deliverance
.
He
accustomed
himself
to
speaking
to
the
new
jailer
,
although
the
latter
was
,
if
possible
,
more
taciturn
than
the
old
<NUMBER>
;
but
still
,
to
speak
to
a
man
,
even
though
mute
,
was
something
.
The
<UNK>
breathed
the
fresh
air
of
heaven
,
and
saw
each
other
.
At
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
often
had
a
feeling
of
pity
for
this
unhappy
young
man
who
suffered
so
;
and
he
laid
the
request
of
number
<NUMBER>
before
the
governor
;
but
the
latter
<UNK>
imagined
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
wished
to
conspire
or
attempt
an
escape
,
and
refused
his
request
.
He
laid
every
action
of
his
life
before
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
proposed
<UNK>
to
accomplish
,
and
at
the
end
of
every
prayer
introduced
the
entreaty
<UNK>
addressed
to
man
than
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
:
``
Forgive
us
our
<UNK>
as
we
forgive
them
that
<UNK>
against
us
.
''
He
could
not
do
this
,
he
whose
past
life
was
so
short
,
whose
present
so
melancholy
,
and
his
future
so
doubtful
.
<UNK>
<UNK>
religious
fervor
.
He
consigned
his
unknown
persecutors
to
the
most
horrible
tortures
he
could
imagine
,
and
found
them
all
insufficient
,
because
after
torture
came
death
,
and
after
death
,
if
not
repose
,
at
least
the
boon
of
<UNK>
.
Once
thus
<UNK>
,
unless
the
protecting
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
snatch
him
thence
,
all
is
over
,
and
his
struggles
but
tend
to
hasten
his
destruction
.
All
his
sorrows
,
all
his
sufferings
,
with
their
train
of
gloomy
spectres
,
fled
from
his
cell
when
the
angel
of
death
seemed
about
to
enter
.
Soon
the
fury
of
the
waves
and
the
sight
of
the
sharp
rocks
announced
the
approach
of
death
,
and
death
then
terrified
me
,
and
I
used
all
my
skill
and
intelligence
as
a
man
and
a
sailor
to
struggle
against
the
wrath
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<NUMBER>
methods
of
<UNK>
were
at
his
disposal
.
He
resolved
to
adopt
the
second
,
and
began
that
day
to
carry
out
his
resolve
.
He
kept
his
word
;
twice
a
day
he
cast
out
,
through
the
barred
aperture
,
the
provisions
his
jailer
brought
him
-
at
first
gayly
,
then
with
<UNK>
,
and
at
last
with
regret
.
He
was
still
young
-
he
was
only
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
and
<NUMBER>
-
he
had
nearly
<NUMBER>
years
to
live
.
The
next
morning
he
could
not
see
or
hear
;
the
jailer
feared
he
was
dangerously
ill
.
It
was
the
twilight
of
that
mysterious
country
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
Although
weakened
,
the
young
man
's
brain
instantly
responded
to
the
idea
that
<UNK>
all
prisoners
-
liberty
!
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
heard
the
sound
.
Suddenly
the
jailer
entered
.
Fortunately
,
he
fancied
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
delirious
;
and
placing
the
food
on
the
<UNK>
table
,
he
withdrew
.
Suddenly
another
idea
took
possession
of
his
mind
,
so
used
to
misfortune
,
that
it
was
scarcely
capable
of
hope
-
the
idea
that
the
noise
was
made
by
workmen
the
governor
had
ordered
to
repair
the
neighboring
dungeon
.
He
saw
but
<NUMBER>
means
of
restoring
<UNK>
and
clearness
to
his
judgment
.
He
soon
felt
that
his
ideas
became
again
collected
-
he
could
think
,
and
strengthen
his
thoughts
by
reasoning
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rose
again
,
but
this
time
his
legs
did
not
tremble
,
and
his
sight
was
clear
;
he
went
to
a
corner
of
his
dungeon
,
detached
a
stone
,
and
with
it
knocked
against
the
wall
where
the
sound
came
.
Full
of
hope
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
bread
and
water
,
and
,
thanks
to
the
vigor
of
his
constitution
,
found
himself
<UNK>
recovered
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
close
his
eyes
.
At
length
<NUMBER>
evening
,
as
the
jailer
was
visiting
him
for
the
last
time
that
night
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
his
ear
for
the
hundredth
time
at
the
wall
,
fancied
he
heard
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
among
the
stones
.
<UNK>
by
this
discovery
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
determined
to
assist
the
indefatigable
<UNK>
.
The
bed
had
iron
<UNK>
,
but
they
were
<UNK>
to
the
wood
,
and
it
would
have
required
a
<UNK>
to
take
them
off
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
concealed
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
of
the
<UNK>
fragments
in
his
bed
,
leaving
the
rest
on
the
floor
.
Day
came
,
the
jailer
entered
.
The
damp
had
rendered
it
<UNK>
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
able
to
break
it
off
-
in
small
morsels
,
it
is
true
,
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
had
<UNK>
off
a
handful
;
a
<UNK>
might
have
calculated
that
in
<NUMBER>
years
,
supposing
that
the
rock
was
not
encountered
,
a
passage
<NUMBER>
feet
long
and
<NUMBER>
feet
broad
,
might
be
formed
.
The
wall
was
built
of
rough
stones
,
among
which
,
to
give
strength
to
the
structure
,
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
stone
were
at
intervals
<UNK>
.
Was
he
to
be
thus
stopped
at
the
beginning
,
and
was
he
to
wait
inactive
until
his
fellow
workman
had
completed
his
task
?
The
jailer
was
accustomed
to
pour
the
contents
of
the
saucepan
into
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
plate
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
eating
his
soup
with
a
wooden
spoon
,
<UNK>
the
plate
,
which
thus
served
for
every
day
.
The
jailer
,
therefore
,
only
grumbled
.
He
left
the
saucepan
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
the
stone
was
extricated
from
the
wall
,
leaving
a
<UNK>
a
foot
and
a
half

cleared
up

During

Perhaps
the

the

with

in

all

not
daring

thinking
thus
to
defer
the
moment
when

should
be
convinced

once
for

that

-
such

be

``

he
said
with

.
``
You

said
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

were
the
following
lines
,
which
I
can
never
forget
:
-
''
`
The
great
wars
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
ended
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
completed
his
conquest
,
had
need

money
to
purchase
all
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
determined
to
make
<NUMBER>
cardinals
.
'
The
pope
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
first
found
the
<NUMBER>
future
cardinals
;
they
were
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
held
<NUMBER>
of
the
highest
dignities
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
See
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<NUMBER>
of
the
noblest
and
richest
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
nobility
;
both
felt
the
high
honor
of
such
a
favor
from
the
pope
.
The
pope
heaped
attentions
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
conferred
upon
them
the
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
,
and
induced
them
to
arrange
their
affairs
and
take
up
their
residence
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
key
was
furnished
with
a
small
iron
point
,
-
a
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
proposed
to
his
father
,
that
they
should
either
ask

cardinals
to
open

cupboard
,
or
shake
hands
with
them
;
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
replied
:
`
Now

to

<PROPER_NOUN>

ask

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
quite
set
up
with

went
with

manner

but
it
was
a
<UNK>
a

who
came
with

on

to
say
from
the
pope
,
`
His

requests
you
to
dine
with
him
.
'
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
pale
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
him
with
an
ironical
air
,
which
proved
that
he
had
anticipated
all
,
and
that
the
snare
was
well
spread
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
the
same
moment
saw
another
bottle
approach
him
,
which
he
was
pressed
to
taste
.
But
the
inheritance
consisted
in
this
only
,
a

of
paper
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
written
:
-
`
I
bequeath

it
was

-
you
know
by
what
mistake

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
in
doubtful
ease

a
mystery
hung
over
this
dark
affair
,

the
public
rumor
was

a

had
carried
off
from

the

``

I
had
often
heard
him
complain

of
his
rank
with
his
fortune
;
and
I
advised
him
to
<UNK>
all
he
had
in
an
annuity

It
was
an

beautiful

with

I

He

''
This

always

still

completely
deserted

It

past

that

and
the
way
in
which

the

at

Dantes

Thus

But
my

But
he
was
continually
thinking
over
some

escape

anticipating
the

would
enjoy

Then
,
once
free

from

His

He

penetrated

''
oh

he
exclaimed
-
``
not

Without
giving
himself
time
to
<UNK>
his
decision
,
and
,
indeed
,
that
he
might
not
allow
his
thoughts
to
be
distracted
from
his
desperate
resolution
,
he
bent
over
the
appalling
shroud
,
opened
it
with
the
knife
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
made
,
drew
the
corpse
from
the
sack
,
and
bore
it
along
the
tunnel
to
his
own
chamber
,
laid
it
on
his
couch
,
tied
around
its
head
the
rag
he
wore
at
night
around
his
own
,
covered
it
with
his
<UNK>
,
once
again
kissed
the
<UNK>
brow
,
and
tried
vainly
to
close
the
<UNK>
eyes
,
which
glared
horribly
,
turned
the
head
towards
the
wall
,
so
that
the
jailer
might
,
when
he
brought
the
evening
meal
,
believe
that
he
was
asleep
,
as
was
his
frequent
custom
;
entered
the
tunnel
again
,
drew
the
bed
against
the
wall
,
returned
to
the
other
cell
,
took
from
the
hiding-place
the
needle
and
thread
,
flung
off
his
rags
,
that
they
might
feel
only
naked
flesh
beneath
the
coarse
canvas
,
and
getting
inside
the
sack
,
placed
himself
in
the
posture
in
which
the
dead
body
had
been
laid
,
and
<UNK>
up
the
mouth
of
the
sack
from
the
inside
.
Now
his
plans
were
fully
made
,
and
this
is
what
he
intended
to
do
.
If
he
was
detected
in
this
and
the
earth
proved
too
heavy
,
he
would
be
stifled
,
and
then
-
so
much
the
better
,
all
would
be
over
.
This
time
the
jailer
might
not
be
as
silent
as
usual
,
but
speak
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
seeing
that
he
received
no
reply
,
go
to
the
bed
,
and
thus
discover
all
.
Then
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
that
the
moment
had
arrived
,
summoned
up
all
his
courage
,
held
his
breath
,
and
would
have
been
happy
if
at
the

he
could
have
repressed
the
<UNK>
of
his
veins
.
``
He

said
<NUMBER>
,
as
he
raised
the
head
.
``
What
would
be
the
use
of
carrying

much
more
weight
?
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
.
It
was
a
sensation
in
which
pleasure
and
pain
were
strangely
mingled
.
he
asked
himself
.
``
Give
us
a
light

''
said
the

,
``
or
I
shall
never
find
what
I

''
``
The

''
As
he
said
this
,
the
man
came
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
heard
a
heavy
<UNK>
substance
laid
down
beside
him
,
and
at
the

moment
a
cord
was
fastened
round
his
feet
with
sudden
and
painful
violence
.
``

on

``

''
``
Well
,
here
we

''
said
<NUMBER>
of
them
.
``
<NUMBER>

''
Although
drawn
downwards
by
the
heavy
weight
which
hastened
his
rapid
descent
,
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
fall
lasted
for
a
century
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
although
stunned
and
almost
suffocated
,
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
hold
his
breath
,
and
as
his
right
hand
-LRB-
prepared
as
he
was
for
every
chance
-RRB-
held
his
knife
open
,
he
rapidly
ripped
up
the
sack
,
extricated
his
arm
,
and
then
his
body
;
but
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
free
himself
from
the
shot
,
he
felt
it
dragging
him
down
still
lower
.
When
he
arose
a
second
time
,
he
was
<NUMBER>
paces
from
where
he
had
first
sunk
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
dived
again
,
and
remained
a
long
time
beneath
the
water
.
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
are
the
nearest

of
all
those

were
therefore
the

venture

By
leaving
this
light
on
the
right
,
he
kept
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
little
on
the
left
;
by
turning
to
the

,
therefore
,
he
would
find
it
.
He
found
with
pleasure
that

had
taken

nothing

and
that
he
was
still
master
of

had
so

sported
as
a

He
swam
on

and
already
the

had
disappeared
in
the

.
But
what
if
I
were
mistaken
?
''
Suddenly
the
sky
seemed
to
him
to
become
still
darker
and
more
dense
,
and
heavy
clouds
seemed
to
sweep
down
towards
him
;
at
the

time
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
knee
.
It
was
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
awakened
by
the
roar
of
thunder
.
An
<UNK>
rock
offered
him
a
temporary
shelter
,
and
scarcely
had
he
availed
himself
of
it
when
the
tempest
burst
forth
in
all
its
fury
.
He
then
recollected
that
he
had
not
eaten
or
drunk
for
four-and-twenty
hours
.
A
second
after
,
he
saw
it
again
,
approaching
with
frightful

.
Above
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
a

rent

<UNK>
was
waving
;
suddenly
the
<UNK>
that
still
held
it
gave
way
,
and
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
like
a
vast
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
down
the

at

being

dashed
to

;
he
listened
,
he
<UNK>
about
,
but
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
-
the
cries
had
ceased
,
and
the
tempest
continued
to
rage
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
stood
mute
and
motionless
before
this
majestic
spectacle
,
as
if
he
now
beheld
it
for
the
first

and
indeed
since
his
captivity
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
had
forgotten
that

The

The

O

''
he
swam
to
the
cap
,
placed
it
on
his
head
,
seized
<NUMBER>
of
the
<UNK>
,
and
struck
out
so
as
to
cut
across
the
course
the

was
taking
.
He
soon
saw
that
the
vessel
,
with
the
wind
dead
ahead
,
was
<UNK>
between
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
tower
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
shouted
,
but
he
knew
that
the
wind
would
drown
his
voice
.
By
a
violent
effort
he
rose
half
out
of
the
water
,
waving
his
cap
,
and
uttering
a
loud
shout
peculiar
to
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
let
go
of
the
timber

which
he
now
thought
to

and
swam
vigorously
to

The
<NUMBER>
sailors
redoubled
their
efforts
,
and
<NUMBER>
of
them
cried
in
Italian
,
``
Courage
!
''
A
convulsive
movement
again
brought
him
to
the
surface
.
His
first
care
was
to
see
what
course
they
were
taking
.
A
sailor
was
rubbing
his
limbs
with
a
<UNK>
cloth
;
another
,
whom
he
recognized
as
the
<NUMBER>
who
had
cried
out
``

said
the

in
bad
French
.
``
Where

''
``
I
was
lost
when
<NUMBER>
of
your

caught
hold
of

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
recollected
that
his
hair
and
beard
had
not
been
cut
all
the
time
he
was
at
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

``
Alas

``

returned
the

smiling
.
``
Then

do

''
The
young
man
took
the
helm
,
felt
to
see
if
the
vessel
answered
the
rudder
promptly
and
seeing
that
,
without
being
a
first-rate
sailer
,
she
yet
was
tolerably
obedient
,
-
``
To

said
he
.
``

``

``

``
Now

A

was
brought

offered

the

The

looked
at
<NUMBER>
another
.
The
captain
glanced
at
him
,
but
he
had
lifted
the
rum
to
his
lips
and
was
drinking
it
with
so
much
composure
,
that
suspicions
,
if
the

had
any

died
away
.
``

``
In

you
ask
me
in

''
I
ask
you
what
year
is
it
?
''
A
sorrowful
smile
passed
over
his
face
;
he
asked
himself
what
had
become
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
must
believe
him
dead
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
been
a
day
on
board
before
he
had
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
men
with
whom
his
lot
had
been
cast
.
He
was
very
well
known
to
the
customs
officers
of
the
coast
;
and
as
there
was
between
these
<UNK>
and
himself
a
perpetual
battle
of
wits
,
he
had
at
first
thought
that
Dantes
might
be
an
emissary
of
these
industrious
guardians
of
rights
and
duties
,
who
perhaps
employed
this
ingenious
means
of
learning
some
of
the
secrets
of
his
trade
.
Thus
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
subtle
as
he
was
,
was
duped
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
whose
favor
his
mild
demeanor
,
his
<UNK>
skill
,
and
his
admirable
dissimulation
,
pleaded
.
He
had
preserved
a
tolerably
good
remembrance
of
what
the
youth
had
been
,
and
was
now
to
find
out
what
the
man
had
become
.
At
this
period
it
was
not
the
fashion
to
wear
so
large
a
beard
and
hair
so
long
;
now
a
barber
would
only
be
surprised
if
a
man
gifted
with
such
advantages
should
consent
voluntarily
to
deprive
himself
of
them
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
entered
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
d'If
with
the
round
,
open
,
smiling
face
of
a
young
and
happy
man
,
with
whom
the
early
paths
of
life
have
been
smooth
,
and
who
<UNK>
a
future
corresponding
with
his
past
.
As
to
his
voice
,
prayers
,
sobs
,
and
imprecations
had
changed
it
so
that
at
times
it
was
of
a
singularly
penetrating
sweetness
,
and
at
others
rough
and
almost
hoarse
.
His
next
care
on
leaving
the
barber
's
who
had
achieved
his
first
metamorphosis
was
to
enter
a
shop
and
buy
a
complete
sailor
's
suit
-
a
garb
,
as
we
all
know
,
very
simple
,
and
consisting
of
white
trousers
,
a
striped
shirt
,
and
a
cap
.
He
had
scarcely
been
a
week
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
before
the
hold
of
his
vessel
was
filled
with
printed
<UNK>
,
contraband
<UNK>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
powder
,
and
tobacco
on
which
the
<UNK>
had
forgotten
to
put
its
mark
.
The
next
morning
going
on
deck
,
as
he
always
did
at
an
early
hour
,
the
patron
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
leaning
against
the
<UNK>
gazing
with
intense
earnestness
at
a
pile
of
granite
rocks
,
which
the
rising
sun
tinged
with
rosy
light
.
But
then
what
could
he
do
without
instruments
to
discover
his
treasure
,
without
arms
to
defend
himself
?
Fortunately
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
learned
how
to
wait
;
he
had
waited
<NUMBER>
years
for
his
liberty
,
and
now
he
was
free
he
could
wait
at
least
<NUMBER>
months
or
a
year
for
wealth
.
It
is
true
,
the
letter
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
singularly
circumstantial
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
repeated
it
to
himself
,
from
<NUMBER>
end
to
the
other
,
for
he
had
not
forgotten
a
word
.
But
on
this
occasion
the
precaution
was
superfluous
,
and
everything
proceeded
with
the
utmost
<UNK>
and
politeness
.
They
turned
the
<UNK>
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
they
intended
to
take
in
a
cargo
,
which
was
to
replace
what
had
been
discharged
.
A
customs
officer
was
laid
low
,
and
<NUMBER>
sailors
wounded
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<NUMBER>
of
the
latter
,
a
ball
having
touched
him
in
the
left
shoulder
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
on
the
way
he
desired
to
follow
,
and
was
moving
towards
the
end
he
wished
to
<UNK>
;
his
heart
was
in
a
fair
way
of
<UNK>
in
his
bosom
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
then
resolved
to
try
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
offered
him
in
return
for
his
attention
a
share
of
his
<UNK>
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
refused
it
<UNK>
.
Then
in
the
long
days
on
board
ship
,
when
the
vessel
,
gliding
on
with
security
over
the
azure
sea
,
required
no
care
but
the
hand
of
the
<UNK>
,
thanks
to
the
favorable
winds
that
swelled
her
sails
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
<UNK>
in
his
hand
,
became
the
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
the
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
his
tutor
.
You
may
<NUMBER>
day
be
the
captain
of
a
vessel
.
He
had
passed
and
<UNK>
his
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
times
,
but
not
once
had
he
found
an
opportunity
of
landing
there
.
But
in
this
world
we
must
risk
something
.
Already
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
visited
this
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
times
,
and
seeing
all
these
hardy
<UNK>
,
who
supplied
the
whole
coast
for
nearly
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
leagues
in
extent
,
he
had
asked
himself
what
power
might
not
that
man
attain
who
should
give
the
impulse
of
his
will
to
all
these
contrary
and
<UNK>
minds
.
The
patron
of
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
proposed
as
a
place
of
landing
the
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

,
which
being

deserted

and
having
neither

seemed
to

placed
in

classes
of
mankind
which
we
in
modern
times
have
separated

which
antiquity
appears
to
have
included
in

Nothing

If
he
closed
his
eyes
,
he
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
letter
written
on
the
wall
in
characters
of
flame
-
if
he
slept
for
a
moment
the
<UNK>
dreams
haunted
his
brain
.
He
then
endeavored
to
re-enter
the
marvellous
grottos
,
but
they
had
suddenly
<UNK>
,
and
now
the
path
became
a
labyrinth
,
and
then
the
entrance
vanished
,
and
in
vain
did
he
tax
his
memory
for
the
magic
and
mysterious
word
which
opened
the
splendid
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
Arabian
fisherman
.
He
had
by
degrees
assumed
such
authority
over
his
companions
that
he
was
almost
like
a
commander
on
board
;
and
as
his
orders
were
always
clear
,
distinct
,
and
easy
of
execution
,
his
comrades
obeyed
him
with
celerity
and
pleasure
.
The
sea
was
calm
,
and
,
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
<UNK>
,
they
sailed
beneath
a
bright
blue
sky
,
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
also
lighted
up
in
turn
his
beacon
lights
,
each
of
which
is
a
world
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
cast
from
solitude
into
the
world
,
frequently
experienced
an
imperious
desire
for
solitude
;
and
what
solitude
is
more
complete
,
or
more
poetical
,
then
that
of
a
ship
floating
in
isolation
on
the
sea
during
the
obscurity
of
the
night
,
in
the
silence
of
immensity
,
and
under
the
eye
of

?
The
Island
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<UNK>
large
in
the
horizon
.
The
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
reddened
by
the
burning
sun
,
was
seen
against
the
azure
sky
.
Never

<UNK>

whose
whole

on
<NUMBER>
cast
of
the
die
,
experience
the
anguish
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
in
his
<UNK>
of
hope
.
He
was
the
first
to
jump
on
shore
;
and
had
he
dared
,
he
would
,
like
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
have
``
kissed
his
mother
earth
.
''
He
questioned
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Should
we
not
do
better
in
the
grottos
?
''
The
cold
sweat
sprang
forth
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
brow
.
For
a
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
speechless
;
then
he
remembered
that
these
caves
might
have
been
filled
up
by
some
accident
,
or
even
stopped
up
,
for
the
sake
of
greater
security
,
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
boat
that
now
arrived
,
assured
by
the
answering
signal
that
all
was
well
,
soon
came
in
sight
,
white
and
silent
as
a
phantom
,
and
cast
anchor
within
a
cable
's
length
of
shore
.
No
one
had
the
slightest
suspicion
;
and
when
next
day
,
taking
a
<UNK>
,
powder
,
and
shot
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
declared
his
intention
to
go
and
kill
some
of
the
wild
goats
that
were
seen
springing
from
rock
to
rock
,
his
wish
was
<UNK>
into
a
love
of
sport
,
or
a
desire
for
solitude
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
on
,
looking
from
time
to
time
behind
and
around
about
him
.
At
this
moment
hope
makes
me
despise
their
riches
,
which
seem
to
me
contemptible
.
The
wise
,
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
be
mistaken
in
this
<NUMBER>
thing
.
Meanwhile
,
by
a
<UNK>
between
<NUMBER>
walls
of
rock
,
following
a
path
worn
by
a
torrent
,
and
which
,
in
all
human
probability
,
human
foot
had
never
before
trod
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
approached
the
spot
where
he
supposed
the
grottos
must
have
existed
.
So
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
to
separate
the
branches
or
brush
away
the
moss
to
know
where
the
<UNK>
were
.
Only
,
might
not
these
betraying
marks
have
attracted
other
eyes
than
those
for
whom
they
were
made
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
concluded
that
perhaps
instead
of
having
reached
the
end
of
the
route
he
had
only
<UNK>
its
beginning
,
and
he
therefore
turned
round
and
<UNK>
his
steps
.
But
even
while
they
watched
his
daring
progress
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
foot
slipped
,
and
they
saw
him
stagger
on
the
edge
of
a
rock
and
disappear
.
They
poured
a
little
rum
down
his
throat
,
and
this
remedy
which
had
before
been
so
<UNK>
to
him
,
produced
the
same
effect
as
formerly
.
As
for
himself
,
he
declared
that
he
had
only
need
of
a
little
rest
,
and
that
when
they
returned
he
should
be
easier
.
All
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
able
to
do
was
to
drag
himself
about
a
dozen
paces
forward
to
lean
against
a
<UNK>
rock
.
``
He
has
broken
his
ribs
,
''
said
the
commander
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
patron
,
``
let
what
may
happen
,
it
shall
never
be
said
that
we
deserted
a

like
you

<PROPER_NOUN>
would
not
allow
that
any
such
<UNK>
of
regular
and
proper
rules
should
be
made
in
his
favor
.
``
I
would
rather
do
so
,
''
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
reply
,
``
than
suffer
the
inexpressible
agonies
which
the
slightest
movement
causes
me
.
''
``
We
can
not
leave
you
here
so
,
and
yet
we
can
not
stay

''
``
Why
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
if
in
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
days
you
hail
any

,
desire
them

``
Listen
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
there
's
<NUMBER>
way
of

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
You
are
a
good

and

,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
heaven
will
recompense
you
for
your
generous
intentions
;
but
I
do
not
wish
any
<NUMBER>
to
stay

.
Then
,
when
they
had
disappeared
,
he
said
with
a
smile
,
-
''
'T
is
strange
that
it
should
be
among
such
men
that
we
find
proofs
of
friendship
and
devotion
.
''
``
And
now
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
remembering
the
tale
of
the
Arabian
fisherman
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
related
to
him
,
``
now
,
open
<UNK>
!
''
In
a
word
,
the
island
was
inhabited
,
yet
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
himself
alone
,
guided
by
the
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
at
the
<UNK>
that
had
left
in
the
morning
,
and
the
tartan
that
had
just
set
sail
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
fixed
his
eyes
.
He
saw
that
he
was
on
the
highest
point
of
the
island
,
-
a
statue
on
this
vast
pedestal
of
granite
,
nothing
human
appearing
in
sight
,
while
the
blue
ocean
beat
against
the
base
of
the
island
,
and
covered
it
with
a
fringe
of
foam
.
This
creek
was
sufficiently
wide
at
its
mouth
,
and
deep
in
the
centre
,
to
admit
of
the
entrance
of
a
small
vessel
of
the
lugger
class
,
which
would
be
perfectly
concealed
from
observation
.
How
could
this
rock
,
which
weighed
several
<UNK>
,
have
been
lifted
to
this
spot
,
without
the
aid
of
many
men
?
He
soon
perceived
that
a
slope
had
been
formed
,
and
the
rock
had
slid
along
this
until
it
stopped
at
the
spot
it
now
occupied
.
After
<NUMBER>
minutes
'
labor
the
wall
gave
way
,
and
a
hole
large
enough
to
<UNK>
the
arm
was
opened
.
But
how
?
He
lighted
it
and
retired
.
The
rock
,
already
shaken
by
the
explosion
,
tottered
on
its
base
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
surprise
;
never
had
a
first
attempt
been
crowned
with
more
perfect
success
.
Any
<NUMBER>
else
would
have
rushed
on
with
a
cry
of
joy
.
I
must
not
be
cast
down
by
the
discovery
that
I
have
been
deceived
.
He
remained
motionless
and
pensive
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gloomy
aperture
that
was
open
at
his
feet
.
This
fabulous
event
formed
but
a
<UNK>
in
a
long
chain
of
<UNK>
.
``
The
fate
,
''
replied
he
,
smiling
,
``
of
those
who
buried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
But
instead
of
the
darkness
,
and
the
thick
and
<UNK>
atmosphere
he
had
expected
to
find
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
a
dim
and
<UNK>
light
,
which
,
as
well
as
the
air
,
entered
,
not
merely
by
the
aperture
he
had
just
formed
,
but
by
the
interstices
and
crevices
of
the
rock
which
were
visible
from
without
,
and
through
which
he
could
distinguish
the
blue
sky
and
the
waving
branches
of
the
<UNK>
oaks
,
and
the
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
that
grew
from
the
rocks
.
``
In
the
farthest
angle
of
the
second
opening
,
''
said
the
cardinal
's
will
.
The
pickaxe
struck
for
a
moment
with
a
dull
sound
that
drew
out
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
forehead
large
drops
of
perspiration
.
Then
a
singular
thing
occurred
.
It
was
there
he
must
dig
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
tasted
nothing
,
but
he
thought
not
of
hunger
at
such
a
moment
;
he
hastily
swallowed
a
few
drops
of
rum
,
and
again
entered
the
cavern
.
The
aperture
was
already
sufficiently
large
for
him
to
enter
,
but
by
waiting
,
he
could
still
cling
to
hope
,
and
retard
the
certainty
of
deception
.
At
the
left
of
the
opening
was
a
dark
and
deep
angle
.
The
time
had
at
length
arrived
;
<NUMBER>
feet
of
earth
removed
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
fate
would
be
decided
.
Had
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
nothing
he
could
not
have
become
more
ghastly
pale
.
A
wild
goat
had
passed
before
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
and
was
feeding
at
a
little
distance
.
He
approached
the
hole
he
had
dug
.
There
was
no
longer
any
doubt
:
the
treasure
was
there
-
no
one
would
have
been
at
such
pains
to
conceal
an
empty
casket
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
inserted
the
sharp
end
of
the
pickaxe
between
the
coffer
and
the
lid
,
and
pressing
with
all
his
force
on
the
handle
,
burst
open
the
<UNK>
.
<NUMBER>
compartments
divided
the
coffer
.
Was
he
awake
,
or
was
it
but
a
dream
?
He
then
set
himself
to
work
to
count
his
fortune
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
light
gradually
disappear
,
and
fearing
to
be
surprised
in
the
cavern
,
left
it
,
his
gun
in
his
hand
.
With
the
first
light
<PROPER_NOUN>
resumed
his
search
.
To
wait
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
the
purpose
of
watching
like
a
<UNK>
over
the
almost
<UNK>
<UNK>
that
had
thus
fallen
into
his
possession
satisfied
not
the
<UNK>
of
his

,
which
<UNK>
to
return
to
dwell
among
mankind
,
and
to
assume
the
rank
,
power
,
and
influence
which
are
always
accorded
to
wealth
-
that
first
and
greatest
of
all
the
forces
within
the
grasp
of
man
.
To
this
question
the
smugglers
replied
that
,
although
successful
in
landing
their
cargo
in
safety
,
they
had
scarcely
done
so
when
they
received
intelligence
that
a
<UNK>
had
just
quitted
the
port
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
was
crowding
all
sail
towards
them
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
preserved
the
most
admirable
self-command
,
not
suffering
the
<UNK>
indication
of
a
smile
to
escape
him
at
the
<UNK>
of
all
the
<UNK>
he
would
have
<UNK>
had
he
been
able
to
quit
the
island
;
but
as
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
merely
come
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
fetch
him
away
,
he
embarked
that
same
evening
,
and
proceeded
with
the
captain
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
scarcely
believe
his
senses
at
receiving
this
magnificent
present
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastened
to
account
for
by
saying
that
he
had
merely
been
a
sailor
from
whim
and
a
desire
to
spite
his
family
,
who
did
not
allow
him
as
much
money
as
he
liked
to
spend
;
but
that
on
his
arrival
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
he
had
come
into
possession
of
a
large
fortune
,
left
him
by
an
uncle
,
whose
sole
heir
he
was
.
Having
seen
<PROPER_NOUN>
fairly
out
of
the
harbor
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
proceeded
to
make
his
final
<UNK>
on
board
The
Young
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
distributing
so
liberal
a
<UNK>
among
her
crew
as
to
secure
for
him
the
good
wishes
of
all
,
and
expressions
of
cordial
interest
in
all
that
concerned
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
struck
with
the
beauty
and
<UNK>
of
the
little
vessel
,
applied
to
its
owner
to
transfer
it
to
him
,
offering
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
francs
,
upon
condition
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
take
immediate
possession
.
The
delighted
builder
then
offered
his
services
in
providing
a
suitable
crew
for
the
little
vessel
,
but
this
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
declined
with
many
thanks
,
saying
he
was
accustomed
to
<UNK>
about
quite
alone
,
and
his
principal
pleasure
consisted
in
<UNK>
his
yacht
himself
;
the
only
thing
the
builder
could
oblige
him
in
would
be
to
contrive
a
sort
of
secret
closet
in
the
cabin
at
his
bed
's
head
,
the
closet
to
contain
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
,
so
constructed
as
to
be
concealed
from
all
but
himself
.
The
boat
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
be
animated
with
almost
human
intelligence
,
so
promptly
did
it
obey
the
slightest
touch
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
required
but
a
short
trial
of
his
beautiful
craft
to
acknowledge
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
without
reason
attained
their
high
reputation
in
the
art
of
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
carefully
noted
the
general
appearance
of
the
shore
,
and
,
instead
of
landing
at
the
usual
place
,
he
dropped
anchor
in
the
little
creek
.
Dantes
employed
it
in
<UNK>
his
yacht
round
the
island
,
studying
it
as
a
skilful
horseman
would
the
animal
he
destined
for
some
important
service
,
till
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
perfectly
conversant
with
its
good
and
bad
qualities
.
He
immediately
signalled
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
to
these
melancholy
tidings
with
outward
calmness
;
but
,
leaping
lightly
ashore
,
he
signified
his
desire
to
be
quite
alone
.
Without
<UNK>
his
secret
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
give
sufficiently
clear
instructions
to
an
agent
.
Still
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
view
without
a
shudder
the
approach
of
a
gendarme
who
accompanied
the
officers
deputed
to
demand
his
bill
of
health
ere
the
yacht
was
permitted
to
hold
communication
with
the
shore
;
but
with
that
perfect
self-possession
he
had
acquired
during
his
acquaintance
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
coolly
presented
an
English
passport
he
had
obtained
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
as
this
gave
him
a
standing
which
a
French
passport
would
not
have
afforded
,
he
was
informed
that
there

Each
step
he
trod
oppressed
his
heart
with
fresh
emotion
;
his
first
and
most
indelible
recollections
were
there
;
not
a

,
not
a

,
that
he
passed
but
seemed
filled
with
dear

cherished
memories

The
<UNK>
and
other

,
which
his
father
had
delighted
to
train
before
his
window
,
had
all
disappeared
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
.
The
tenants
of
the
humble
lodging
were
a
young
couple
who
had
been
scarcely
married
a
week
;
and
seeing
them
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
sighed
heavily

When

withdrew
from

they
both
accompanied

downstairs

<UNK>
their

would
come
again
whenever

and
assuring
him
that
their

ever

This
strange

aroused
great
wonder
and
curiosity
in

<PROPER_NOUN>

and
a

were

none

Such

about

a

a

from

hung

<UNK>
in

a

covered

Between

grew
a

of

,
and
<UNK>
;
while
,
<UNK>
and
solitary

like

a

raised
its

and
displayed
its
flexible

summit
dried

This

During
the
days
of
his
prosperity
,
not
a
festivity
took
place
without
himself
and
wife
being
among
the
spectators
.
At
the
moment
<PROPER_NOUN>
quitted
his
<UNK>
watch
before
the
door
,
the
road
on
which
he
so
eagerly
strained
his
sight
was
void
and
lonely
as
a
desert
at
mid-day
.
His
rider
was
a
priest
,
dressed
in
black
,
and
wearing
a
three-cornered
hat
;
and
,
spite
of
the
ardent
rays
of
a
<UNK>
sun
,
the
pair
came
on
with
a
fair
degree
of
rapidity
.
At
this
unusual
sound
,
a
huge
black
dog
came
rushing
to
meet
the
daring
<UNK>
of
his
ordinarily
tranquil
abode
,
<UNK>
and
displaying
his
sharp
white
teeth
with
a
determined
hostility
that
abundantly
proved
how
little
he
was
accustomed
to
society
.
``
Now
,
then
,
<UNK>

''
cried
he
,
speaking
to
the

,
``
will
you
be
quiet

Then
perceiving
for
the
first
time
the
garb
of
the
traveller
he
had
to
entertain
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
hastily
exclaimed
:
``

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
anxious
not

the

opportunity
of
finding
a

for
<NUMBER>
of
the
few
bottles
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
remaining
in

,
hastily
raised
a
trap-door
in
the
floor
of
the
apartment
they
were
in
,
which
served
both
as
parlor
and
kitchen
.
``
Quite

replied
the

-

''
The
abbe
fixed
on
him
a
searching
,
penetrating
glance
.
``
You
are
wrong
to
speak
thus
,
''
said
the
abbe
;
``

perhaps
I
may

be

``
What

Why

``
You

the

without
taking
any

``
You

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
a

``

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
here
the
look
of
the

,
becoming
more

more
fixed

seemed
to
rest
with
ill-concealed
satisfaction
on
the

was
rapidly
spreading
over
the

exclaimed

Some

was

The

after

he

at

murmured
the

The
French
government
,
without
protecting

openly

gave

it

In

<PROPER_NOUN>
started

turned

he
said

taking
up

it
seemed

<UNK>
these

it

he
attached
so
little
importance

so
much

Like

so
all

<PROPER_NOUN>
had

no

the

had
learnt
from

weighed
anchor
at

The
young

,
wishing
to
spare
his

the
pain
of
this
interview

questioned
the
new-comer

the

declared

nothing

that
his
business

On
the
staircase
they
met
a
beautiful
girl
of
<NUMBER>

who
looked
with
anxiety
at
the
stranger

``

entered

was

,
by
the
aid

a
key
he
possessed

opened
a
door

the
corner

a
landing-place
on
the
second
staircase

conducted
the

into
an

opened
a

which

closed
behind

and
after
having
left
the

the
house

<PROPER_NOUN>
alone

returned

signed
to

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at

with
an
air

curiosity

evidently
mingled
with
interest

``

It

what
<PROPER_NOUN>
suffered
during

At
this
almost
brutal
speech
<PROPER_NOUN>
turned
<UNK>
pale

<PROPER_NOUN>
shuddered
,
and
looked
at
the
man

who
spoke
with
more
assurance
than
he
had
hitherto
shown

``
Well

returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

it
seemed

expected
something

occasioned

noise

something
must
follow

At
this

the

opened

and
the

her

bathed
with

appeared

clasping

descended

already
<NUMBER>

That

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,

cries
the
captain
;
`
very
well

said
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

To

my

as

'
It
was
time
,
for
just
as
I
jumped
the
deck
burst
with
a
noise
like
the
<UNK>
of
a
man-of-war
.
A
general
murmur
of
approbation
showed
that
the
narrator
had
faithfully
detailed
their
misfortunes
and
sufferings
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
let

``
At

added
he
,
``
I
should
have
said

Give

but
times

and
the

that
remains

is
not
my

''
``
Well
''
-
``
Well
,
we
all
say

<PROPER_NOUN>
nearly
swallowed
his
quid
;
fortunately
he
recovered
.
``
No

Then
you
must
not
pay
us

we
can
<UNK>

under

``
At

we
shall
see
each

He
made
a
sign
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
went
first
;
the
seamen
followed
him
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
brought
up
the
rear
.
The
<NUMBER>
men
were
left
alone
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
A
delay
would
save
my
honor
,
and
consequently
my
life

''
``
I
will
give
you
<NUMBER>

''
replied
the
stranger
.
``
Yes

''
The
bills
were
renewed
,
the
old
ones
destroyed
,
and
the
poor
<UNK>
found
himself
with
<NUMBER>
months
before
him
to
collect
his
resources
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
<NUMBER>

you
will
receive
a

signed
`
<PROPER_NOUN>
the

``
I
swear
to
you
I

.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
faint
cry
,
blushed
like
a
rose
,
and
leaned
against
the
baluster
.
The
<UNK>
provided
for
by
the
agent
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
&
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the
moment
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
expected
it

,
was
to
the
poor
shipowner
so
decided
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
he
almost
dared
to
believe
that
fate
was
at
length
grown
weary
of
<UNK>
her
spite
upon
him
.
Unfortunately
,
whether
through
envy
or
stupidity
,
all
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
correspondents
did
not
take
this
view
;
and
some
even
came
to
a
contrary
decision
.
The
opinion
of
all
the
commercial
men
was
that
,
under
the
reverses
which
had
successively
weighed
down
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
remain
<UNK>
.
Formerly
his
paper
,
at
any
date
,
was
taken
with
confidence
,
and
was
even
in
request
.
As
to
the
sailors
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
must
have
found
<UNK>
<UNK>
elsewhere
,
for
they
also
had
disappeared
.
He
brought
him
also
the
amount
of
his
wages
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
dared
to
apply
for
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
attributed
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
embarrassment
to
the
elegance
of
his
attire
;
it
was
evident
the
good
fellow
had
not
gone
to
such
an
expense
on
his
own
account
;
he
was
,
no
doubt
,
engaged
on
board
some
other
vessel
,
and
thus
his
<UNK>
arose
from
the
fact
of
his
not
having
,
if
we
may
so
express
ourselves
,
worn
mourning
for
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
longer
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
rolled
by
in
<UNK>
efforts
on
the
part
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
renew
his
credit
or
revive
the
old
.
All
this
was
incomprehensible
,
and
then
,
with
the
tenacity
peculiar
to
<UNK>
of
bad
news
,
the
failure
was
put
off
until
the
end
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
without
taking
a
crown
from
his
pocket
,
could
save
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
had
but
to
pass
his
word
for
a
loan
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
saved
.
He
embraced
his
weeping
wife
and
daughter
,
pressed
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
hand
with
friendly
warmth
,
and
then
going
to
his
private
room
on
the
second
floor
had
sent
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Besides
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
though
hardly
<NUMBER>
and
<NUMBER>
,
had
great
influence
over
his
father
.
For
a
year
he
had
held
this
rank
,
and
expected
promotion
on
the
first
<UNK>
.
They
had
not
mistaken
the
gravity
of
this
event
,
for
the
moment
after
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
entered
his
private
office
with
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
the
latter
leave
it
pale
,
trembling
,
and
his
features
betraying
the
utmost
consternation
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
examined
the
ledgers
,
opened
the
portfolio
,
and
counted
the
money
.
This
calmness
was
more
alarming
to
the
<NUMBER>
women
than
the
deepest
<UNK>
would
have
been
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
to
comfort
the
women
,
but
his
eloquence
faltered
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
sent
her
daughter
to
bed
,
and
half
an
hour
after
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
retired
,
she
rose
,
took
off
her
shoes
,
and
went
stealthily
along
the
passage
,
to
see
through
the
keyhole
what
her
husband
was
doing
.
They
had
understood
each
other
without
speaking
.
In
the
evening
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
told
her
mother
,
that
although
he
was
apparently
so
calm
,
she
had
noticed
that
her
father
's
heart
beat
violently
.
Why
did
her
father
ask
for
this
key
which
she
always
kept
,
and
which
was
only
taken
from
her
in
childhood
as
a
punishment
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
pretence
to
feel
for
the
key
.
She
questioned
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
he
knew
nothing
,
or
would
not
say
what
he
knew
.
They
had
expected

since
the
previous
evening

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
<UNK>

his

more
affectionate

,
than
he
had
ever
been
.
``
I
wish
you
to
do
so
,
''
said
he
.
She
looked
up
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
.
``
Mother

said
the
young

,
looking
alternately
at

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
her

``

''
``
Read

he
said
,
handing
it
to
her
.
She
opened
it
quickly
and
read
:

Her
innocence
had
kept
her
in

of
the
dangers
that
might
<UNK>
a

of

She
hastened
down
and
told

Did

``

he
said
;

cried
she

hastening
away
with

Then

rushing

out

he
ran
up-stairs

A

concealed
by

``
Yes

Then
they
lift

again

go
under
at

It
is
probable
that
if

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have

now
that

he
thought
it

be

said

,

As
they
drew
near
the

seemed
to
lift
from

,
and
the
air
was
so
clear
that
they
could

were

did
not
evince

You

<PROPER_NOUN>
consulted
with

after

minutes

discussion
a

was
executed
which
caused
the

to
tack
about

returned
the

in

the

disappeared

hidden

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who

fixed

held

Every

on

remained
motionless
for

when
the

was

observed

the

was

on

Through

then
exchanged

It

that
so
astonished
the

Although

returned
the

The

without

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
handsome

this
is
not
all

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
endowed
with
all
those

which
are
so
much
more
<UNK>

Thus

it
was
almost
tremblingly
that

resumed
her

had
yielded
in

when
she
looked
at

of
the
young
man
,
she
understood
by
his
silence
and
trembling
voice
that
something
strange
was
passing
within
him
.
When
the

of

had
driven
away

from

he
said
,

<PROPER_NOUN>

what
were
you
thinking
of
as
you
danced
opposite
the
young
Countess
of

'
`
He
was
right
,
'
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
The
young

,
much
astonished
,
raised
her

to
look
at

his

was
so
gloomy
and
terrible
that
her

<UNK>
to

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
of

took
fire
in
the

adjoining
the

of
the

All

surrounded
her

offering

As

the
danger

run

him
rather
a
favor
of
providence
than
a
real
misfortune
,
-
the
loss
occasioned
by
the
conflagration
was
to
him
but
a
trifle
.
The
young

was
very
pensive
,
but
seeing
<PROPER_NOUN>
so
cheerful
,
she
on
her

assumed
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
pushed

for
on
the
crest
of
a
small

which
cut
off
the

stopping

threw

``

the

;

The
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
may
well
be
supposed
,
awakened
in
him
a
world
of
recollections
,
as
had
the
name
of
the
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
on
the
previous
evening
.
As
he
came
within
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
paces
of
the
grotto
,
he
thought
he
heard
a
cry
.
He
bounded
like
a
<UNK>
,
cocking
his
carbine
as
he
went
,
and
in
a
moment
reached
the
summit
of
a
hill
opposite
to
that
on
which
he
had
perceived
the

.
Vampa
measured
the
distance
;
the

was
at

<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
paces
in
advance
of

,
and
there
was
not
a

of
overtaking
him

Vampa
then
rushed
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
for
at
<NUMBER>
paces
from
the
dying
man
her
legs
had
failed
her
,
and
she
had
dropped
on
her
knees
,
so
that
the
young

feared
that
the
ball
that
had
brought
down
his
enemy
,
had
also
wounded
his
betrothed
.
His
eyes
remained
open
and
menacing
.
Vampa
gazed
on
him
for
a
moment
without
betraying
the
slightest
emotion
;
while
,
on
the
contrary
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
shuddering
in
every

,
dared
not
approach
the

<UNK>

by

and
threw
a

at

over

of
her

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
body
in
his
arms
and
conveyed
it
to
the
grotto
,
while
in
her
turn
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
outside
.
He
wore
a
vest
of
<UNK>
velvet
,
with
buttons
of
cut
gold
;
a

waistcoat
covered
with
embroidery
;
a

tied
round

;
a

fastened

<NUMBER>

hung
from

was
in

The

saw
the

produced
on

,
and
a
smile
of
pride
passed
over
his
lips
.
-
`
And
follow

'
They
went
towards
the
forest
,
and
soon
entered
it
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
this

road
,
which

enclosed
between

What

then

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
raising
his

with
a

of

while

no

able

clung

`
What

'
At
the

of
<NUMBER>

the

made

a

the

,

Here

the

the

And

``
Well

turning

So
saying
,
the
<NUMBER>
young
men
went
down
the
staircase
,
and
got
into
the
carriage
.
Seated
with
folded
arms
in
a
corner
of
the
carriage
,
he
continued
to
ponder
over
the
singular
history
he
had
so
lately
listened
to
,
and
to
ask
himself
an
interminable
number
of
questions
touching
its
various
circumstances
without
,
however
,
arriving
at
a
satisfactory
reply
to
any
of
them
.
The
carriage
stopped
near
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
;
the
door
was
opened
,
and
the
young
men
,
eagerly
alighting
,
found
themselves
opposite
a
cicerone
,
who
appeared
to
have
sprung
up
from
the
ground
,
so
unexpected
was
his
appearance
.
Thus
,
then
,
the
young
men
made
no
attempt
at
resistance
,
but
blindly
and
<UNK>
surrendered
themselves
into
the
care
and
<UNK>
of
their
<UNK>
.
All
at
once
his
ear
caught
a
sound
resembling
that
of
a
stone
rolling
down
the
staircase
opposite
the
<NUMBER>
by
which
he
had
himself
ascended
.
And
his
appearance
had
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
;
but
the
hesitation
with
which
he
proceeded
,
stopping
and
listening
with
anxious
attention
at
every
step
he
took
,
convinced
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
he
expected
the
arrival
of
some
person
.
The
person
whose
mysterious
arrival
had
attracted
the
attention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
stood
in
a
kind
of
<UNK>
,
that
rendered
it
impossible
to
distinguish
his
features
,
although
his
dress
was
easily
made
out
.
Some
few
minutes
had
elapsed
,
and
the
stranger
began
to
show
manifest
signs
of
impatience
,
when
a
slight
noise
was
heard
outside
the
aperture
in
the
roof
,
and
almost
immediately
a
dark
shadow
seemed
to
<UNK>
the
flood
of
light
that
had
entered
it
,
and
the
figure
of
a
man
was
clearly
seen
gazing
with
eager
scrutiny
on
the
immense
space
beneath
him
;
then
,
as
his
eye
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
mantle
,
he
grasped
a
floating
mass
of
thickly
matted
boughs
,
and
glided
down
by
their
help
to
within
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
feet
of
the
ground
,
and
then
leaped
lightly
on
his
feet
.
But
even
if
you
had
caused
me
to
wait
a
little
while
,
I
should
have
felt
quite
sure
that
the
delay
was
not
occasioned

``

Saying
these
words
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
disappeared
down
the
staircase
,
while
his
companion
,
<UNK>
his
features
more
closely
than
before
in
the
folds
of
his
mantle
,
passed
almost
close
to

,
and
descended
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
let
him
proceed
without

and
,
in
fact

did
not
hear
what
was

he
longed

be
alone

free
to
ponder
over
all
that
had
occurred

Under

<PROPER_NOUN>
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
resist
his
extreme
curiosity
to
know
more
of
so
singular
a
personage
,
and
with
that
intent
have
sought
to
renew
their
short
acquaintance
;
but
in
the
present
instance
,
the
confidential
nature
of
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
made
him
,
with
propriety
,
judge
that
his
appearance
at
such
a
time
would
be
anything
but
agreeable
.
<UNK>
out
at
length
,
he
fell
asleep
at
daybreak
,
and
did
not
awake
till
late
.
Neither
had
he
neglected
to
ascertain
the
name

be
played
that

at

also
what

Still
,
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
displayed
his
most
dazzling
and
effective
costumes
each

he
visited
the

;
but
,
alas

his
elegant
toilet
was
wholly
thrown
away
,
and
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
worthy
representatives
of
Parisian
fashion
had
to
carry
with
him
the
<UNK>
reflection
that
he
had
nearly
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
without
meeting
with
a

adventure

none
of
those
interesting
adventures
fell
in
his
way
;
the
lovely
Genoese
,
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
and
<UNK>
were
all
faithful
,
if
not
to
their
husbands
,
at

to
their

,
and
thought
not
of
changing
even
for
the
splendid
appearance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
all
he
gained
was
the
painful
conviction
that
the

have
this
advantage
over
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

that
they
are
faithful
even
in
their
infidelity

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
however

hoped
to
<UNK>
himself

Another
motive
had
influenced
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
selection
of
his
seat
,
-
who
knew
but
that
,
thus
advantageously
placed

he
might
not

attract
the
notice

,

introduction
might
ensue

procure

the

or
a
place
in
a
princely
balcony
,
from
which
he
might
behold
the

The

At

the

perceived

graciously
waved
her
hand
to

he
replied
by
a
respectful
inclination

the
head

it

``
You
were
with

``
Upon

``
My

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
to
him

continued
to
point
his

at

in
the
theatre

At

opened

the
young

who
was
seated
beside

in
obedience
to
the
Italian
custom

instantly
rose
and
surrendered
his

to
the
strangers

who
,
in

,
would
be
expected
to
retire
upon
the
arrival

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
soon
deeply
engrossed
in
<UNK>
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
Parisian
matters
,
speaking
to
the

of
the
various
persons
they
both
knew
there

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
<UNK>
breaking
in
upon

apparently
interesting

passing
between

to
inquire
of
the
former
if
she
knew
who
was
the
fair
<UNK>
opposite

since
beauty
such
as
hers
was
well
worthy
of
being
observed
by
either
sex

``
Oh

consider

Of
this
he
took
no
heed
,
but
was
,
as
far
as
appearances
might
be
trusted
,
enjoying
soft
repose
and
bright
celestial
dreams
.
The
countenance
of
the
person
who
had
addressed
her
remained
so
completely
in
the
shade
,
that
,
though
<PROPER_NOUN>
tried
his
utmost
,
he
could
not
distinguish
a

the
most

terrible
<UNK>
that
has
ever
emanated
from
the
fruitful
pen
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
All
doubt
of
his
identity
was
now
at
an
end
;
his
singular

evidently
resided
at

``
Perhaps

continued
the

taking
up
the

directing

toward
the
box
in

``

This

drew
a

could

Upon

the

became
more
dense

above

<NUMBER>
objects
were
visible
:
the

surmounted
by

which

meet
,
the
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
of
the
scaffold
,
between
which
glittered
the
<UNK>
knife
of
the
mandaia
.
On
chairs
were
laid
elegant
masquerade
costumes
of
blue
and
white
satin
.
*
The
knife
,
which
is
shaped
like
a
<UNK>
,
that
cuts
with
the
<UNK>
side
,
falls
from
a
less
height
,
and
that
is
all
the

.
These
<NUMBER>
men
were
the
executioner
's
assistants
.
All
the
rest
of
the
square
was
paved
with
heads
.
And
yet
,
instead
of
the
silence
and
the
solemnity
demanded
by
the
occasion
,
laughter
and
jests
arose
from
the
crowd
.
Behind
the
penitents
came
a
man
of
vast
stature
and
proportions
.
Behind
the
executioner
came
,
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
to
die
,
first
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
then
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
supported
by
<NUMBER>
priests
.
The
count
alone
seemed
unmoved
-
nay
,
more
,
a
slight
color
seemed
striving
to
rise
in
his
pale
cheeks
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
a
handsome
young
man
of
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
,
<UNK>
by
the
sun
;
he
carried
his

erect
,
and
seemed
on
the
watch
to
see
on
which

his
liberator
would
appear
.
</UL>
``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
to

``

''
``
If

there

The
chief
took
the
paper
,
unfolded
it
,
and
,
raising
his
hand
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
be
praised
,

his

said
he
in

voice
;
``
here

''
``
Pardon

And
he
passed
the
paper
to
the
officer
commanding
the
carbineers
,
who
read
and
returned
it
to
him
.
We
ought
to
die
together
.
And
he
broke
from
the
priests
struggling
and
<UNK>
like
a
wild
beast
,
and
striving
desperately
to
break
the
cords
that
bound
his
hands
.
``
Do
you
not
see

''
Meanwhile
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
<NUMBER>
executioners
were
struggling
on
the
ground
,
and
he
kept
exclaiming
,
``
He

die

seizing
the
young
men
's
hands
-
``
look

for
on

During

the

raised

This

could
contain
himself
no

sank
,
half
fainting

into

He
glanced
mechanically
towards

the

was
wholly
changed
;
scaffold

all

It

the

Their
toilet
finished
,
they
descended
;
the
carriage
awaited
them
at
the
door
,
filled
with
sweetmeats
and
bouquets
.
A

of

flowed
in
from

emerging

descending
from

A

him

the

springing
out

As

throwing

At

the

sounded
the

reassured

compelled

,
in

seemed
to

Her
first
look
was
at
the
box
where
she
had
seen
the
count
the
previous
evening
,
so
that
she
perceived
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
in

``

said
she
,
hardly
giving
<PROPER_NOUN>
time
to
sit
down
,

A

``
No

we

``

This
circumstance
had
,
moreover
,
the
effect
of
changing
the
conversation
;
an
hour
afterwards
the
<NUMBER>
friends
returned
to
their
hotel
.
This
picturesque
attire
set
him
off
to
great
advantage
;
and
when
he
had
bound
the
scarf
around
his
waist
,
and
when
his
hat
,
placed
<UNK>
on
<NUMBER>
side
,
let
fall
on
his
shoulder
a
stream
of
ribbons
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
forced
to
confess
that
costume
has
much
to
do
with
the
physical
superiority
we
accord
to
certain
nations
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
although
a
companion
is
agreeable

perfect

The
young

wished
to
decline
,
but
they
could
find
no
good
reason
for
refusing
an
offer
which
was
so
agreeable
to
them
.
A
few
words
he
let
fall
showed
them
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
sciences
,
and
he
seemed
much
occupied
with
chemistry
.
The
permission
to
do
what
he
liked
with
the
carriage
pleased
him
above
all
,
for
the
fair
peasants
had
appeared
in
a
most
elegant
carriage
the
preceding
evening
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
sorry
to
be
upon
an
equal
footing
with
them
.
At
the
second
turn
,
a
bunch
of
fresh
violets
,
thrown
from
a
carriage
filled
with
<UNK>
,
indicated
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
,
like
himself

his
friend
,
the
peasants
had
changed
their
costume
,
also
;
and
whether
it
was
the
result
of
chance
,
or
whether
a
similar
feeling
had
possessed
them
both
,
while
he
had
changed
his
costume
they
had
assumed
his
.
It
is
almost
needless
to
say
that
the
<UNK>
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
fair
peasant
continued
all
day
.
On
his
return
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
carefully
avoided
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
he
brought
away
with
him
a
treasure
of
pious

,
to
which
the
mad
gayety
of
the
<UNK>
would
have
been
<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
congratulated
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
received
his
congratulations
with
the
air
of
a
man
conscious
that
they
are
merited
.
He
insisted
upon
it
,
declaring
beforehand
that
he
was
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
the
other
wished
.
He
felt
assured
that
the
perfect
indiscretion
of
his

would
duly
inform
him
of
all
that
happened
;
and
as

during

<PROPER_NOUN>

a

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
by
no

sorry
to
learn
how
to
act
on
such
an
occasion

The
evening
was
no
longer
joy
,
but
delirium
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
was
I
mistaken
?
''
This
word
was
pronounced
in
a
manner
impossible
to
describe
.
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
received
that
morning
an
invitation
from
the
celebrated
Roman
banker
.
``
You
have
read
the
letter

''
``
Yes

''
``
You

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

as
he
returned
the
letter

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
I

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
informed
them
that
business

called
him
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
man
was
an
enigma
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
consequence
,
he
brought
them
the
key
of
his
own
-
at

such
was
the
apparent
motive
of
his
visit
.
He
could
not
refrain
from
admiring
the
severe
beauty
of
his
features
,
the
only
defect
,
or
rather
the
principal
quality
of
which
was
the
pallor
.
The
count
was
no

young

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
less
enthusiastic
;
but
the

exercised

announced

in

he
informed

for

At
length
<PROPER_NOUN>
came

the
last

most
tumultuous
day
of
the

The

In

At

The

ranged
themselves
against

;
then
the
trampling
of

and
the
clashing
of
steel
were
heard

Then
the
Castle
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
fired
<NUMBER>
cannon
to
indicate

began
to
burn
among
the
crowd

It

impossible

This

folly

continued
for

;

was
light
as

On

All

commit

It
is
a

owes

All

on

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
`
they
fancy
that
their
countryman
is
still
emperor

But
he
was
a
man
of
stone
.
From
this
moment
I
declare
the
vendetta
against
you
,
so
protect

as
well
as

``
He
knew
so
well
,
that
from
that
moment
he
shut
himself
in
his
house
,
and
never
went
out
<UNK>
,
seeking
me
high
and
low
.
The
most
important
thing
was
,
not
to
kill
him
only
-
for
I
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
a
<NUMBER>
times
-
but
to
kill
him
without
being
discovered
-
at
least
,
without
being
arrested
.
I
followed
him
thither
,
and
I
saw
him
enter
the
house
where
we
now
are
,
only
,
instead
of
entering
by
the
great
door
that
looks
into
the
street
,
he
came
on

,
or
in
his
carriage
,
left
the
<NUMBER>
or
the

at
the
little
inn
,
and
entered
by
the
gate
you
see
there
.
''
The
house
belonged
,
as
the
concierge
informed
your
excellency

to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
father-in-law

As
she
had
a
loose
muslin
dress
on
and
as
nothing
concealed
her
figure
,
I
saw
she
would
ere
long
become
a
mother
.
The
man
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
I
fully
believed
that
when
he
went
out
in
the
night
he
would
be
forced
to
traverse
the
whole
of
the
garden
alone
.
''
``
That
evening
,
''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
I
could
have
killed
the
procureur
,
but
as
I
was
not
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
neighborhood
,
I
was
fearful
of
not
killing
him
on
the
spot
,
and
that
if
his
cries
were
overheard
I
might
be
taken
;
so
I
put
it
off
until
the
next
occasion
,
and
in
order
that
nothing
should
escape
me
,
I
took
a
chamber
looking
into
the
street
bordered
by
the
wall
of
the
garden
.
I
descended
rapidly
;
although
I
had
not
seen
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
face
,
I
recognized
him
by
the
beating
of
my
heart
.
Nothing
,
then
,
preventing
my
escape
by
this
means
,
I
examined
the
grounds
.
The
faint
<UNK>
of
the
pale
moon
,
hidden
momentarily
by
masses
of
dark
clouds
that
were
sweeping
across
the
sky
,
<UNK>
the
gravel
walks
that
led
to
the
house
,
but
were
unable
to
pierce
the
obscurity
of
the
thick
<UNK>
,
in
which
a
man
could
conceal
himself
without
any
fear
of
discovery
.
As
the
last
stroke
died
away
,
I
saw
a
faint
light
shine
through
the
windows
of
the
private
staircase
by
which
we
have
just
descended
.
The
man
in
the
mantle
advanced
towards
me
,
but
as
he
drew
near
I
saw
that
he
had
a
weapon
in
his
hand
.
I
then
perceived
that
he
was
hiding
something
under
his
mantle
,
which
he
laid
on
the
grass
in
order
to
dig
more
freely
.
I
know
not
if
he
heard
these
words
;
I
think
he
did
not
,
for
he
fell
without
a
cry
.
``
No
,
your
excellency

''
returned
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
it
was
a
vendetta
followed
by
restitution

''
``
Yes

excellency

I
hastened
to
the
river
,
sat
down
on
the
bank
,
and
with
my
knife
forced
open
the
lock
of
the
box
.
In
my
turn
I
uttered
a
cry
,
but
a
cry
of
joy
.
``
It
was
an
embarrassing
load
for
a
man
seeking
to
escape
.
''
A
fortnight
after
I
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
I
said
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
`
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
No

do
not

``
The

was
the
crime

which
you
were
accused
when

asked

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
,
and
resumed
his
story
.
Since
my
brother
's
assassination
in
the
streets
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
had
never
entered
the
town
;
the
result
was
that
the
inn-keeper
with
whom
we
were
connected
,
seeing
that
we
would
no
longer
come
to
him
,
was
forced
to
come
to
us
,
and
had
established
a
branch
to
his

,
on
the
road
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the
sign
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

So
,
<UNK>
death
to
capture
,
I
accomplished
the
most
astonishing
deeds
,
and
which
,
more
than
once
,
showed
me
that
the
too
great
care
we
take
of
our

is
the
only
obstacle
to
the
success
of
those
projects
which
require
rapid
decision
,
and
vigorous
and
determined
execution
.
``
My

became
more

more
extensive

more
productive

Our

lasted
nearly

been

take

we
ran
our

returned
home
full
of
joy

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
guessed
all
.
`
Ah

cried
I

He
was

with
large

eyes

of
that

that
<UNK>
so
well
with

<UNK>
complexion
;
only
his
hair
,
which
was
too
light

gave
his
face
a
most
singular
expression

and
added
to
the

of
his
look

and
the
malice
of
his
smile

This

for
whom
my

would
go
to

<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
leagues
off

to
purchase
the

When

the

been
several

threatened

I
spoke

and
proposed
to

to
accompany

endeavoring

tempt

by
all
the

most

the

Why

perfectly

for
when
the

him

The

was
restored
,

the

and
their
<UNK>
was
increased
at

in

at

Whether
success
rendered

betrayed
,
I
know
not
;

<NUMBER>
evening

about

An

in

was
apparently
not

Caderousse

From

changing
his

she
extended

touched

on

How
long
I
had
been
in
this
unconscious
state
I
know
not
,
when
I
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
report
of
a
pistol
,
followed
by
a
fearful
cry
.
<UNK>
raising
myself
on

arm
,
I
looked
around
,
but
all
was
dark
;

it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
rain
must
have
penetrated
through
the
flooring
of
the
room
above
,
for
some
kind
of
moisture
appeared
to
fall
,
drop
by

upon

when

passed
my

Having
obtained
the
light
,
he
hurried
up-stairs
again
,
and
once
more
I
heard
his
rapid
and
uneasy
footsteps
.
I
fancied
that
I
still
heard
faint
moans
,
and
imagining
that
the
unfortunate
jeweller
might
not
be
quite
dead
,
I
determined
to
go
to
his
relief
,
by
way
of
<UNK>
in
some
slight
degree

not

prevent

It

<UNK>
past
her

and
ascended
to

sleeping

which
presented
an
appearance

the
<UNK>
disorder
.
I
approached
the
jeweller
,
who
was
not
quite
dead
,
and
at
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
and
the
creaking
of
the
floor
,
he
opened
his
eyes
,
fixed
them
on
me
with
an
anxious
and
inquiring
gaze
,
moved
his
lips
as
though
trying
to
speak
,
then
,
overcome
by
the
effort
,
fell
back
and
expired

They
threw
themselves
upon
me

I
pointed
to
the
spot
where
I
had
concealed
myself

replied
the

showed
the

I
had
made
when
I
broke
through

A

only

was
left
me

that

the

That

by

produced
the

In

At

In

every

appeared

drawn
by

the

fell
over

snapped

therefore
prevented
the

pursuing

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
carried
them
both
to

I

The

<UNK>
pale

He

he
exposed
his

He

Now

It

I

it

I

say

sir

that

that
is

the
law

most
frequently
found

``

Unless

I

and
therefore
it
is
that
I
utter
the

even

extended

The

more

no

You

Then
there

opened
the
<UNK>
box

the

presented
to
him

and
inhaled
the
odor

with
the

an

thoroughly
appreciated
their

``
How

The

struck
half-past

the

<UNK>

there
chanced
to
be
on
that

a

ordinary
attraction
at

It
happened
that
on

night
the

placed
at

upon

during

in

in

There

the

gone
without

,
while
the
addition
of
a

in

enabled
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>

;
``
the

There
was
a

To-day

``
Oh

a

<NUMBER>

''
``
But
there
were
<NUMBER>
races
,
were
there

''
again
interposed
some
of
the
audience
.
The
fact
was
,
nobody
had
observed
a
horse
entered
by
the
name
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

or
that
of
a
jockey
styled
<PROPER_NOUN>

when
,
at
the

,
a
splendid

,
mounted
by
a
jockey
about
as
big
as
your
fist
,
presented
themselves
at
the
<UNK>
.
``
You

that
the

cried
the
pit
in
chorus

``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

aside
her

somewhat
inferior

by
the

But
that
which
completed
the
almost
masculine
look
Morcerf
found
so
little
to
his
taste
,
was
a
dark
<UNK>
,
of
much
larger
dimensions
than
these
<UNK>
of
nature
generally
are
,
placed
just
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
;
and
the
effect
tended
to
increase
the
expression
of
<UNK>
that
characterized
her
countenance
.
It
was
<UNK>
that
she
was
an
object
of
almost
paternal
interest
to
<NUMBER>
of
the
principal
<UNK>
of
the
day
,
who
excited
her
to
spare
no
pains
in
the
cultivation
of
her
voice
,
which
might
hereafter
prove
a
source
of
wealth
and
independence
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
were
amongst
the
first
to
avail
themselves
of
this
permission
.
cried
the
countess
,
extending
her
hand
to
him
with
all
the
warmth
and
cordiality
of
an
old
acquaintance
;
``
it
was
really
very
good
of
you
to
recognize

quickly

``
So

``
I
am
sorry

the
baron

I

just

''
``
The

Pray

I
concluded
that
,
by
some
singular
chance
,
the
owner
of
the
winning
horse
must
live
in
the

hotel

myself

entered

I
beheld
the

gold
cup
awarded
as
a
prize

the
unknown
horse

rider

``
That

the

;

so
far
from
the
sensation
excited
in
the
Parisian
circles
by
the
appearance

<PROPER_NOUN>
having
abated

I
take

asked

lady
was

beautiful

while
the
rich
magnificence

drew

entered

closed

The

looked
at

then
took
a
survey

his

almost
immediately
reverted
to
the
proprietor

When

At

he
<NUMBER>

received

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
smiling
;
``

not
apply

''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
why
did
you
not
bring
him
close
to
the
gate
,
so
that
I
could
talk
to
him

him
?
''
I
asked
the
price
;
they
told
me
it
was
<NUMBER>
francs
.
I
never
play
,
for
I
am
not
rich
enough
to
afford
to
lose

sufficiently
poor

I
am
almost

The

who

it
must
have
taken
me
for
a
madman
,
for
I
rushed
at

to
the
stable
.
Now
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
I
firmly
believe
that
he
knew
of
my
wish

possess
this

that

lost

give
me
the

Do
you
hear

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

happy

The
little
hand
was
then
immediately
withdrawn
,
and
the
young
man
saw
<PROPER_NOUN>
hurrying
towards
the
house
,
as
though
she
were
almost
terrified
at
her
own
sensations
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
,
which
moved
upon
<UNK>
,
in
which
he
was
<UNK>
into
the
room
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the

way
drawn
out
again
at
night
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
hair
was
long
and
white
,
and
flowed
over
his
shoulders
;
while
in
his
eyes
,
shaded
by
thick
black
lashes
,
was
concentrated
,
as
it
often
happens
with
an
organ
which
is
used
to
the
<UNK>
of
the

,
all
the
activity

force
,

intelligence
which

formerly
diffused
over

so
although
the
movement

arm
,
the
sound
of
the
voice
,
and
the
agility

the
body

were
wanting

the
speaking
eye
sufficed
for
all
.
But
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
his
father
but
seldom
,
and
then
only
when
absolutely
obliged
,
and
as
he
never
took
any
pains

please

gratify
him
when
he
was
there
,
all
the

's
happiness
was
centred
in
his

As

he
had
,
as

been
with

it

was
he
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
now
took

added

pronounced

the
pupil

he
darted

furious

rose
in

not

vent

appeared
almost

choke

turned
quite
purple
with
the
struggle

``
Yes

I
understand

was
the
reply
contained
in
his
look

this

expressed
a

she
bit
her

said
,

was
sufficient

tell

there
was

on

in

There
was
no

continued

During

saw

gave

At
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
count
dismounted
and
began
to
ascend
by
a
little
winding
path
,
about
<NUMBER>
inches
wide
;
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
found
himself
stopped
by
a
hedge
,
upon
which
green
fruit
had
succeeded
to
red
and
white
flowers

The
garden
was
crossed
by
a
path
of
red
gravel
,
edged
by
a

of
thick
box
,
of
many
years

and
of
a
tone

color
that
would
have
delighted
the

of

our
modern

And
yet
it
was
not
because
the
damp
had
been
<UNK>
from
the
garden
;
the
earth
,
black
as
<UNK>
,
the
thick
foliage

betrayed
its
presence
;
besides
,
had
natural
<UNK>
been
wanting
,
it
could
have
been
immediately
supplied
by
artificial
means
,
thanks
to
a

of
water

sunk
in
<NUMBER>

upon

who
,
from

no

always
remained
on

opposite

Suddenly
he
struck
against
something
crouching
behind
a

filled
with
leaves
;
the
something
rose
,
uttering
an
exclamation
of
astonishment

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
found
himself
facing
a

about

who
was
plucking
strawberries

grape
leaves

expressed

ran
to

immediately
hastened

had
eaten
some

<PROPER_NOUN>

concluded

that

and
that
not

come
together

it
would
not
be
difficult
for

to
leave

At
that
moment
a
hand
touched
his
shoulder
.
Did
the
young
man
recognize
that
face
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
in
his
tilbury
,
or
was
he
merely
struck
with
the
horrible
appearance

his
interrogator

At

no

the

reflected
a
little

for
he
went
towards
his

saying

But
a

to
give

at

this

the

has
repeated
it

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
words

did
not
believe

The

thrown
back
from

her

already
sunken
by

of

almost
disappeared
beneath

swollen
with

The

standing

were
looking

departed

hanging
over
the

The
poor
child
appeared
herself
to
require
the
doctor
she
had
recommended
to
her
aged
relative
.
Her
secret
had
each
time
been
repressed
when
she
was
about
to
reveal
it
,
by
the
sad
conviction
that
it
would
be
useless

do
so
;
for

were
it
once
discovered
by
her
father

,
all

be
lost

she
exclaimed
,
``
let

come
in

''
The
young
girl
kissed
her
grandmother
,
and
left
with
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
;
at
the
door
she
found
the
valet
de
chambre
,
who
told
her
that
the
doctor
was
waiting
in
the
dining-room
.
``
Oh

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

he

colored

``

``

repeated
the

.
``
In

``
Yes

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
he

``
An
extreme
nervous

and
a

agitated

she
fancied
this
morning
in
her
sleep
that
her

was
hovering
above
her
body
,
which
she
at
the

watched
.
``
We

go

said
the

After
remaining
for

in
the

she
turned
into

led
to
the

then
from

she
went
to
the

As

she

His

realized

his

him

The

returned

waited
all

all
the

day
without
getting
any
message

o'clock

<UNK>
-
My
poor
grandmother
gets
worse
and
worse
;
yesterday
her
fever
amounted
to
delirium
;
to-day
her
delirium
is
almost
madness

Then
he
went
to
call
on
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
heard
still
more
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
more
affectionate
than
ever
,
-
indeed
,
his
manner
was
so
kind
that
several
times
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
on
the
point
of
telling
him
all
.
Each
time
he
read
it
he
renewed
his
vow
to
make
her
happy
.
She
becomes
at
once
a
queen
and
a
wife
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
thank
and
love
her
sufficiently
.
When
the
afternoon
arrived
and
he
felt
that
the
hour
was
drawing
near
,
he
wished
for
solitude
,
his
agitation
was
extreme
;
a
simple
question
from
a
friend
would
have
irritated
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
tormented
his
so
effectually
that
they
struck
<NUMBER>
at
half-past
<NUMBER>
.
The
night
gradually
drew
on
,
and
the
foliage
in
the
garden
assumed
a
deeper
hue
.
The
house
,
which
was
discernible
through
the
trees
,
remained
in
darkness
,
and
gave
no
indication
that
so
important
an
event
as
the
signature
of
a
marriage-contract
was
going
on
.
The
slightest
rustling
of
the
foliage
,
the
least
whistling
of
the
wind
,
attracted
his
attention
,
and
drew
the
perspiration
to
his
brow
;
then
he
tremblingly
fixed
his
ladder
,
and
,
not
to
lose
a
moment
,
placed
his
foot
on
the
first
step
.
And
then
he
walked
rapidly
to
and
fro
,
and
pressed
his
burning
forehead
against
the
fence
.
The
idea
that
her
strength
had
failed
her
in
attempting
to
escape
,
and
that
she
had
fainted
in
<NUMBER>
of
the
paths
,
was
the
<NUMBER>
that
most
impressed
itself
upon
his
mind
.
At
last
the
half-hour
struck
.
However
,
he
had
not
ventured
thus
far
to
draw
back
.
Instead
of
lights
at
every
window
,
as
is
customary
on
days
of
ceremony
,
he
saw
only
a
gray
mass
,
which
was
veiled
also
by
a
cloud
,
which
at
that
moment
obscured
the
moon
's
feeble
light
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
guessed
all
this
.
At
this
sound
,
as
he
was
already
partially
exposed
to
view
,
he
stepped
back
and
concealed
himself
completely
,
remaining
perfectly
motionless
.
They
descended
,
and
advanced
towards
the
clump
of
trees
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
soon
recognized
the
other
gentleman
as
Doctor
d'Avrigny
.
What
a
dreadful
death
-
what
a
blow
!
Who
could
be
dead
in
that
house
,
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
had
called
accursed
?
``
Can
it
be
possible
?
''
``
Yes
,
quite
;
but
why
all
these
precautions
?
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
horrified
,
supported
his
head
with
<NUMBER>
hand
,
and
with
the
other
pressed
his
heart
,
lest
its
beatings
should
be
heard
.
``
Madame

was
,
doubtless
,
advancing

but

''
Villefort
answered
nothing
,
he
simply
raised
his
head
,
which
had
been
cast
down
before
,
and
looked
at
the
doctor
with
amazement
.
``
Did

Then
I
understood
from
your
countenance
there
was
more
to
fear
than
I
had
thought

``
And
at
the
third
she
expired

``
That
the

A

placed
on
the
mantle-piece
threw
some
of
its
pale
rays
without
,
and
a
shadow
was
seen
for
<NUMBER>

on
the
balcony
.
This

became
an

by
<NUMBER>
of
the
incomprehensible
transports

he
bounded

crossed

having

the

he
reached

ran

up

opened

Meanwhile

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
traversed
the

found
the

being

prevented

a

arrived
at

<UNK>

``

He

assumed

If

the

became

on

he

<UNK>
every

The

was
partially

<PROPER_NOUN>
sat

Not

His

``
Alas

no

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
a

still
more

She
was
somewhat

exquisitely
formed

a

figure

with
large
curls
falling
on
her

which
was
rather

sometimes
makes
his

her

dull
from
fatigue

He
then
led
the

into

either
by
chance

the

was
partially
closed

Then

All

dark

<NUMBER>
solitary

in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

the

sought
his

A

engaged

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

At

The

The

his

under

the

The

The

The

advanced
to

Then
he
raised
his

withdrew

immediately

treated
this

As

it
is
needless
to

that

they

The

My

The

after
leaning
an

against

he

<NUMBER>
o'clock
struck

reached
the

a

was
travelling

Then
be
went
to

almost

fell
into

sleep

visit

even

Once

About
<NUMBER>
in

was
awakened
by
a
ray
of
<UNK>
,
which
played

warm

brilliant

upon

A
gendarme
was
crossing

Then

all
at

he
replied

with

remarked
in

``

Not

there

perceived

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
indebted
for
this
visit
to
the
following
circumstances

The
sentinel
who
was
relieved
at
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
remembered
perfectly
that
just
as
he
was
taking
his
post
a
few
minutes
past
<NUMBER>
a
young
man
arrived
on
horseback
,
with
a
little
boy
before
him
.
``
Oh
,
ho
,
''
said
the
brigadier
,
who
thoroughly
understood
the
trick
;
``
a
bad
sign
to
find
the
door
open
!
We
say
<UNK>
,
because
the
brigadier
was
too
experienced

be
convinced
by
a
single
proof
.
The
fire
<UNK>
,
and
the
smoke
ascended
like
the
dull
vapor
from
a
volcano
;
but
still
no
prisoner
fell
down
,
as
they
expected

It
was
now
his
turn
to
look
about
him
;
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
massive
sixteenth

was
on

right
;
any

descend

openings
in
the
tower
,
and
examine
every
corner

roof
below
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
expected
momentarily
to
see
the
head
of
a
gendarme
appear
at
<NUMBER>
of
these
openings
.
For
an
instant
it
remained
motionless
as
<NUMBER>
of
the
stone
decorations
of
the
building
,
then
after
a
long
sigh
of
disappointment
the
head
disappeared
.
``
Well
,
my
boys

''
said
the
brigadier
,
``
the
brigand
must
really
have
escaped
early

``
Some
traveller
seems
impatient

the
host

At
this
moment
the
screams
and
ringing
were
redoubled
.
The
bell
here
rang
for
the
third
time
,
with
another
shriek
of
anguish
.
``
Good

said
the
brigadier
.
``
Well

you
guard
the
exterior

fire
upon

a

criminal

from
what
the

says

It
would
have
signified
little
had
the
room
been
empty

but
unfortunately
it
was
occupied

``
For
pity

he
cried

pale

bewildered

without
seeing
whom
he
was
addressing

<NUMBER>
of

``

at
length
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
return
by

say
nothing

The
brigadier
had
put
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
,
and
had
discovered
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
a
posture
of
entreaty

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose
pity
returned
as
her
fears
diminished
;
``
fly

''
``
Kill
myself

The
brigadier
advanced
to
him
,
sword
in
hand
.
<UNK>
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
And
with
this
raillery
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
out
,
leaving
the
<NUMBER>
girls
a
prey
to
their
own
feelings
of
shame

to
the
comments
of
the
crowd

``
Oh

We
have
seen
how
quietly
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
accomplished
their
transformation

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
very
much
regretted
that
the
marriage
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
not
taken
place
,
not
only
because
the
match
was
good
,
and
likely
to
insure
the
happiness
of
her
child
,
but
because
it
would
also
set
her
at
liberty

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
play
,
and
the
conversation
,
which
had
become
interesting
during
the
discussion
of
such
serious
affairs
,
lasted
till
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
baroness
returned
to
the
hotel
with
as
much
caution
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
used
in
leaving
it
;
she
ran
lightly
up-stairs
,
and
with
an
<UNK>
heart
entered
her
apartment
,
contiguous
,
as
we
know
,
to
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
called
the
maid
and
questioned
her
.
And
then
the
baroness
remembered
that
she
had
felt
no
pity
for
poor
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
been
afflicted
with
as
severe
a
blow
through
her
husband
and
son
.
And
her
glance
was
turned
towards
heaven
,
where
a
mysterious
providence
disposes
all
things
,
and
out
of
a
fault
,
nay
,
even
a
vice
,
sometimes
produces
a
blessing
.
To
whom
would
she
apply
to
help
her
out
of
this
painful
situation
?
But
,
no
;
on
reflection
,
the
procureur
was
not
a
merciless
man
;
and
it
was
not
the
magistrate
,
slave
to
his
duties
,
but
the
friend
,
the
loyal
friend
,
who
roughly
but
firmly
cut
into
the
very
<UNK>
of
the
<UNK>
;
it
was
not
the
executioner
,
but
the
surgeon
,
who
wished
to
withdraw
the
honor
of
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
from
<UNK>
association
with
the
<UNK>
young
man
they
had
presented
to
the
world
as
their
son-in-law
.
She
would
invoke
the

,
recall
old
recollections

would
supplicate

remembrance
of
guilty

yet
happy

and
drove
to

house
.
<NUMBER>
times
did
the
bell
ring
with
a
dull
,
heavy
sound
,
seeming
to
<UNK>
,
in
the
general
sadness
,
before
the
concierge
appeared
and
peeped
through
the
door
,
which
he
opened
just
wide
enough
to
allow
his
words
to
be
heard
.
``
First
,
madame
,
who
are
you
?
''
``
You
must
be
mad

said
the

``
Oh

extraordinary

Is

''
``
Yes

The

appeared
on
the

<UNK>
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
with
the
object
of
her
visit

the
treatment
she
had
received
from
these
<UNK>
appeared
to
her
so
insulting

that
she
began
by
complaining
of
it
.
``
You

then

are
unhappy

``
<UNK>

madame

``
You

''
``
Well
,
then

be
more
affectionate

my

said
the
baroness
.
That
is
the
reason
that
by
the
side
of
my
misfortunes
yours
appear
to
me
mere
<UNK>
;
that
is
why
my
dreadful

makes
yours

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
indeed
!
``
You
are
too
late
,
madame
;

-
The
procureur
shook
his
head
.
said
the
baroness
,
half
jesting
,
half
in
earnest
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
what
you
mean

he
said
;
``
you

''
The
baroness
became
pale
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
his
armchair
nearer
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
then
resting
both
hands
upon
his
desk
he
said
in
a
voice
more
hollow
than
usual
:
``
There
are
crimes
which
remain
unpunished

-LRB-
<PROPER_NOUN>
here
extended
his

toward
a

placed
opposite
to

-

promised

you
see

a

an

''
``
Has
no

owned

The
baroness
clasped
her
hands
.
-
the

.
No

madame
;
the

has
commanded

and
when
it

it
strikes

Have

<PROPER_NOUN>

madame

replied
the
king

attorney
,
as
in
an
almost
joyful
manner
he
conducted
her
to
the
door
.
<UNK>
down
with
fatigue
,
she
was
indeed
confined
to
her
bed
;
and
it
was
in
her
own
room
,
and
from
the
lips
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
that
she
heard
all
the

or
rather
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
together
with
the
accusation

pronounced
against

At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
<PROPER_NOUN>
retired
to
his
study
,
at
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
arrived
,
bringing
the
night
draught
prepared
for
the
young

,
and
then
M.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
carried
away
.
Certainly
,
though
<PROPER_NOUN>
still
labored
under
dreadful
nervous
excitement
,
she
was
better
;
and
moreover
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
told
him
when

half
distracted
,
he
had
rushed
to
the
count
's
house
,
that
if
she
were
not
dead
in
<NUMBER>
hours
she
would
be
saved
.
On
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
learned
of
the
flight
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the
arrest
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
<PROPER_NOUN>
having
retired
as
well
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
her
thoughts
wandered
in
a
confused
<UNK>
,
alternately
<UNK>
her
own
situation
and
the
events
she
had
just
heard
.
<NUMBER>
minutes
had
elapsed
since
the
nurse
had
left
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
for
the
last
hour
had
been
suffering
from
the
fever
which
returned
nightly
,
incapable
of
controlling
her
ideas
,
was
forced
to
yield
to
the
excitement
which
exhausted
itself
in
producing
and
<UNK>
a
succession
and
<UNK>
of
the
same
fancies
and
images
.
From
behind
the
door
a
human
figure
appeared
,
but
the
girl
was
too
familiar
with
such
apparitions
to
be
alarmed
,
and
therefore
only
stared
,
hoping
to
recognize
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Still
,
she
felt
her
pulse
,
and
finding
it
throb
violently
she
remembered
that
the
best
method
of
<UNK>
such
illusions
was
to
drink
,
for
a
draught
of
the
beverage
prepared
by
the
doctor
to
<UNK>
her
fever
seemed
to
cause
a
<UNK>
of
the
brain
,
and
for
a
short
time
she
suffered
less
.
Then
the
figure
,
from
whom
she
could
not
detach
her
eyes
,
and
who
appeared
more
protecting
than
menacing
,
took
the
glass
,
and
walking
towards
the
<UNK>
held
it
up
,
as
if
to
test
its
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
shuddered
.
she
murmured
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
reply
;
the
voice
which
indicated
the
real
presence
of
a
being
in
the
room
,
alarmed
her
so
much
that
she
feared
to
utter
a
syllable
;
still
the
expression
of
her
eyes
seemed
to
inquire
,
``
If
your
intentions
are
pure
,
why
are
you
here
?
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
He
told
me
your
life
was
his

and
I
have
promised
him
that
you
shall
live

''
Are
you
a
doctor
?
''
-
I
have
not
seen
you
.
''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
he
answered
,
``
during
my
long
watch
over
you
,
all
I
have
observed
has
been
what
people
visited
you

what

was
prepared
,
and
what
beverage
was
served
;
then
,
when
the
latter
appeared
dangerous
to
me

I
entered

as
I
have
now
done

substituted

in
the
place
of
the
poison

a
<UNK>
draught
;
which
,
instead
of
producing
the
death
intended
,
caused
life
to
<UNK>
in
your
veins

''
But
drink
some
of
this
;
''
and
the
count
took
a
bottle
from
his
pocket
,
containing
a
red
liquid
,
of
which
he
poured
a

drops
into
the
glass

``
Oh

yes

''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I

refreshed

seemed

ease

the
wretched
hours
I

endured

the
torture
to
which
I
have
submitted
when
I
saw
the
deadly
poison
poured
into
your
glass

how
I
trembled
lest

drink
it
before
I
could
find

to
throw
it
away

``
You
saw

He
has
been
fortifying
you

his
beloved
child

against
the
fatal
effects

the
poison

which
has
failed
because
your

impregnated

``
You
shall

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
listening
.
``
Oh

heavens

''
exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
wiping
off
the
drops
which
ran
down
her
forehead
.
``
I
think
I
hear
a
noise

she
said
;
``
leave
me

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
alone
;
<NUMBER>
other
clocks

<UNK>
than
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
struck
the
hour
of
midnight
from
different
directions
,
and
excepting
the
<UNK>
of
a
few
carriages
all
was
silent
.
To
what
end
?
Supposing
this
person
,
wearied
at
the
<UNK>
of
the
poison
,
should
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
intimated
,
have
recourse
to
steel
!
But
through
the
door
she
fancied
she
saw
the
luminous
eye
of
the
count
-
that
eye
which
lived
in
her
memory
,
and
the
recollection
overwhelmed
her
with
so
much
shame
that
she
asked
herself
whether
any
amount
of
gratitude
could
ever
repay
his
adventurous
and
devoted
friendship
.
Some
<NUMBER>
approached
the
bed
and
drew
back
the
curtains
.
Still
silent
:
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
promised
not
to
awake
.
During
this
short
time
<PROPER_NOUN>
must
have
held
her
breath
,
or
moved
in
some
slight
degree
,
for
the
woman
,
disturbed
,
stopped
and
leaned
over
the
bed
,
in
order
the
better
to
ascertain
whether
<PROPER_NOUN>
slept
-
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Then
collecting
all
her
remaining
strength
,
she
forced
herself
to
close
her
eyes
;
but
this
simple
operation
upon
the
most
delicate
organs
of
our
frame
,
generally
so
easy
to
accomplish
,
became
almost
impossible
at
this
moment
,
so
much
did
curiosity
struggle
to
retain
the
<UNK>
open
and
learn
the
truth
.
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sensations
experienced
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
during
the
minute
and
a
half
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
in

``
Well

said
he
,
``
do

``
Did

``

repeated
the

almost
bewildered

``

Well

clasping

She
took
it
,
and
looked
attentively
on
the
count
;
there
was
an
expression
on
the
face
of
her
intrepid
protector
which
commanded
her
veneration

emptied

after
throwing
a

glance
on

who
slept
with
the
confidence

of
an

All

in

ceased

the
silence
was
frightful

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
emptied
the

disturbed

then
she
carefully
<UNK>
the

wiping

but
the
<UNK>
seemed
to
be
slightly
distorted
by
convulsion
,
and
the
hand
,
so
delicately
formed
,
was
resting
with
stiff
outstretched
fingers
on
the
framework
of
the
bed
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
no
longer
any
doubt
;
all
was
over
-
she
had
consummated
the
last
terrible
work
she
had
to
accomplish
.
<UNK>
with
agitation
,
the
poisoner
succeeded
in
<UNK>
her
way
to
the
door
,
and
reached
her
room
in
an
agony
of
fear
.
``
Good
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
approaching
the
table
,
``
she
has
taken
part
of
her
draught
;
the
glass
is
three-quarters
empty
.
''
She
tried
to
replace
the
arm
,
but
it
moved
with
a
frightful
rigidity
which
could
not
deceive
a
<UNK>
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
But
before
the
doctor
and
the
father
could
reach
the
room
,
the
servants
who
were
on
the
same
floor
had
entered
,
and
seeing
<PROPER_NOUN>
pale
and
motionless
on
her
bed
,
they
lifted
up
their
hands
towards
heaven
and
stood
transfixed
,
as
though
struck
by
<UNK>
.
But
instead
of
obeying
him
,
the
servants
stood
watching
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
ran
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
raised
her
in
his
arms
.
``
Oh
,
where
will
be
the
end
?
''
``
I
say
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
dead
!
''
Just
then
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
the
act
of
slipping
on
her
dressing-gown
,
threw
aside
the
drapery
and
for
a
moment
stood
motionless
,
as
though
interrogating
the
occupants
of
the
room
,
while
she
endeavored
to
call
up
some
rebellious
tears
.
The
spectre
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
rising
before
the
poisoner
would
have
alarmed
her
less
.
Then
he
ran
to
<NUMBER>
of
the
cupboards
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
,
which
had
been
transformed
into
a
medicine
closet
,
and
taking
from
its
silver
case
a
small
bottle
of
<UNK>
<UNK>
,
dropped
a
little
of
it
into
the
liquor
,
which
immediately
changed
to
a
<UNK>
color
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
alone
had
followed
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
his
eyes
,
and
watched
her
hurried
retreat
.
``
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
''
-
stammered
the
nurse
.
``
Dead
!
''
This
is
what
had
happened
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
no
particular
reason
for
uneasiness
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
promised
him
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
should
live
,
and
so
far
he
had
always
fulfilled
his
word
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
room
was
opened
,
like
all
the
rest
.
``
Well
,
''
answered
the
old
man
,
by
closing
his
eyes
;
but
his
appearance
manifested
increasing
uneasiness
.
He
turned
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
the
pallor
and
anguish
expressed
on
his
countenance
momentarily
increased
.
``
What
is
the
matter
?
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
signed
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
continued
the
old
man
.
A
sob
was
the
only
sound
he
heard
.
and
another
voice
which
,
like
an
echo
repeated
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
-
dead
!
''
``
Who
are
you
,
sir
,
''
he
asked
,
``
that
forget
that
this
is
not
the
manner
to
enter
a
house
stricken
with
death
?
-
do
you
hear

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
seen
carrying
,
with
superhuman
strength
,
the
arm-chair
containing
<PROPER_NOUN>
up-stairs
.
That
pale
face
and
flaming
glance
appeared
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
like
a
frightful
apparition
.
``
See
,
my
father
,
see
!
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
towards
the
old
man
and
made
him
inhale
a
powerful
<UNK>
.
As
for
the
old
man
,
his
chest
heaved
with
his
panting
respiration
.
Tell
them
she
was
my
beloved
,
my
noble
girl
,
my
only
blessing
in
the
world
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
nothing
;
he
had
grasped
the
hand
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
unable
to
weep
vented
his
agony
in
groans
as
he
bit
the
sheets
.
But
you
see
that
the
angel
whom
you
hoped
for
has
left
this
earth
-
she
has
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
adoration
of
men
.
You

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
send
for
the
priest
;
I
will
be
the
avenger

''
The
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
glistened
,
and
d'Avrigny
approached
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
increasing
vehemence
,
``
no

is
allowed
;
I
denounce

it
is
your

``
Assuredly

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
lighted
up
with
rage
,
and
d'Avrigny
prepared
to
speak
.
I
tell
you
that
the
dose
has
been
double
,
the
poison
changed
,
and
that
this

it
has
succeeded

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
well

then
,
I
appeal
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
.
``
Yes

yes

''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
recall
the
scene
,
for
the

thought
were
only
given
to

solitude
fell
into
my

Then
d'Avrigny
spoke
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
raised
his
head
,
and
reading
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
,
which
gleamed
with
unnatural
lustre
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
he
said
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

to
speak

''
``
Yes
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
<NUMBER>
of
those
melancholy
smiles
which
had
so
often
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
happy
,
and
thus
fixed
his
attention
.
``
Yes
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Whom
am
I
to
take
with
me
?
``
Yes

''
``
Yes

''
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
faltering
footstep
was
heard
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
staying
,
<NUMBER>
absorbed
in
meditation
,
the

in
grief
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
``
give
me
your

of
honor

remain
buried

``
But

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
the
culprit

the
murderer

''
``
Yes

''
resolutely
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
old
man
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
d'Avrigny
looked
inquiringly
.
We
have
before
stated
that
all
the
servants
had
fled
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
be
persuaded
to
quit
his
grandchild
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
near
the
bed
,
pale
,
motionless
,
and
silent
as
the
corpse
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
kind
of
hoarse
,
rattling
sound
;
the
old
man
's
eyes
sparkled
,
and
the
good
doctor
understood
that
he
wished
to
behold
his
child
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
met
them
at
the
door
of
his
study
;
having
in
a
few
words
thanked
the
district
doctor
,
he
turned
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
said
,
-
``
And
now
the
priest
.
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
fetch
the

.
''
Here
is
the
key
of
the
door
,
so
that
you
can
go
in
and
out
as
you
please
;
you
will
bring
the
priest
with
you
,
and
will
oblige
me
by
introducing
him
into
my
child
's
room
.
''
A
priest
can
understand
a
father
's
grief
.
''
``
This
is
the
abbe
of
whom
I
spoke
,
''
said
the
doctor
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
priest
,
in
a
marked
Italian
accent
;
``
yes
,
I
have
heard
that
death
is
in
that
house
.
''
``
I
know
it
,
sir
;
the

fled
from

informed

``
I

sir

and
I
do
not
hesitate

say

mine

''
In
order
,
doubtless
,
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
while
fulfilling
his
sacred
mission
,
the
priest
rose
as
soon
as
d'Avrigny
departed
,
and
not
only
bolted
the
door
through
which
the
doctor
had
just
left
,
but
also
that

During

engaged

and
contrary

all
expectation
there
was
no

in
withdrawing
him
from
his
child
.
They
both
stood
in
amazement
at
the
door
.
And
this
is
the
more
strange
,
since
the
least
contradiction
keeps
him
awake
all
night
.
''
I
have
filled
those
papers
,
and
have
made
out
the
accusation
against
the
assassin
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
No

I
have
a

He

Those

were

soon
formed
into

``
Indeed

<PROPER_NOUN>

the

drew
near

When

For

look

``

he
answered

The

The

if

the

The

turned

;
he

not

The

looked
at
<NUMBER>

with
low

a
storm
gathered
over
the
head
of
the
aristocratic
prisoner
,
raised
less
by

than
by
the
manner

Others
proposed

which
the

beat

<PROPER_NOUN>
But
<PROPER_NOUN>

turning

winked
his

his

The

he
took
<PROPER_NOUN>
by

began
examining

<UNK>
the

exclaimed
an
inspector
.
said
the

voice
.
Certainly
a

had
scarcely
astonished
<PROPER_NOUN>
less
than

youth

instead

had
maintained
a
rigid
silence

Why
should
I
risk
an
imprudent
step
?
The
unfortunate
youth
was
intrepid
in
the
attack
,
and
rude
in

defence

It
was
too
soon
for

from
the

too

for

be

Then
he
mentally
added

The

spoke
for

with
an

then
opened
the

conducted
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
a

on

You

``

in

was
moved
to

``

the

``
Can

he
added

turning
towards
<PROPER_NOUN>

Perhaps
it
was
the
Christian

of
the
abbe
,
perhaps
his
kind
charity
,
perhaps
his
persuasive
words
,
which
had
restored
the
courage
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
ever
since
he
had
conversed
with
the
priest
his
violent
despair
had
yielded
to
a
calm
resignation
which
surprised
all
who
knew
his
excessive
affection
for

This
affair
,
like
all
those
in
which
the
Count
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
interfered

caused
a
great
sensation

He
had
been
obliged
to
<UNK>
himself
more
than

to
evade
the
enormous
number
of

presented

him
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
<UNK>
of
admission
to

court
on

day

More
than
once
he
had
reached
that
part
of
the
garden
where
the
famous
boarded
gate
stood
overlooking
the
deserted
enclosure
,
always
returning
by
the

path
,
to
begin
his
walk
again
,
at
the

pace
and
with
the

gesture
,
when
he
accidentally
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
house
,
whence
he
heard
the
noisy
play
of
his
son
,
who
had
returned
from
school
to
spend
the

<PROPER_NOUN>

Then
he

,
which
were
nearly
<UNK>
of
foliage
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
sitting
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
the
perusal
of

she
frequently
interrupted
to
smile
upon
her
son
,
or
to
throw
back
his
<UNK>
ball
,
which
he
obstinately
threw
from
the
drawing-room
into
the
garden
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
begged
for
a
long
while
,
the
maternal
kiss
probably
not
offering
sufficient
recompense
for
the
trouble
he
must
take
to
obtain
it

however
at

he
decided
,
leaped
out

window
into
a

of
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
,
and
ran
to
his
mother
,
his
forehead
streaming
with
perspiration
.
In
that
earnest
look
might
be
read
a
deep
reproach
,
as
well
as
a
terrible
menace

<PROPER_NOUN>
violently
<UNK>
his
great-coat
,
which
seemed
to
strangle
him
,
and
passing
his
livid
hand
across
his

,
entered
his
study
.
The
magistrate
had
slept
for
a
short
time
while
the
lamp
sent
forth
its
final
struggles
;
its
<UNK>
awoke
him
,
and
he
found
his
fingers
as
damp

purple
as
though
they

been
dipped
in

His

dropped
upon

and
in

he
paced
his

;
then
he
threw
himself
,
dressed

was

upon
a
sofa
,
less
to
sleep
than
to
rest
his

cramped
with

up

almost

he

He
was
concealed
in

he
saw
my

bury
something
in
the

stabbed
him
;

``

Just
then
a

cry
,
ending
in
a

burst
from
the

of
the

who
encircled
the

``

Every

turned
towards
the

who
,
unable

gaze
now
riveted
on

advanced

dishevelled

with

asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
the
<UNK>
,
slipping
a
louis
into
his
hand
.
Many
people
have
been
assassinated
in

Those

when
the

Having
staggered
as
far
as
the

he
perceived
his

awoke
his

threw

on

and
pointed
towards
the

;
the

drove
on

Behind
the
event

overwhelmed
him
he
saw
the
hand
of

He
thought
of
his

His

``

he
exclaimed

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
leaped
out
of
the

and
saw
that
his
servants
were
surprised
at
his
early
return
;
he
could
read
no

He
then
closed
the
door

With
a
single
glance
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
eye
ran
through
the
room
.
he
cried
.
``

cried

``

rattling
noise

seemed
to
tear
her
throat

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
dead

and
he
rushed
out

still
crying

``

``
Then

slowly
returned

with

hand
wiping
his

,
and
with
the

supporting
himself
against
the
wall

``

He
stepped
forward

The

man
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
;
a
ray
of
light
seemed
to
penetrate
the
abyss
of
despair
and
darkness

He
leaped
over
the
corpse
as
if
it
had
been
a

<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
thunderstruck
,
fell
upon
his
knees
;
the
child
dropped
from
his
arms
,
and
rolled
on
the
floor
by
the
side
of
its
mother

Then
a
piercing
cry
escaped
from
his
breast
,
and
he
cried
,

He
descended

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whose

was
balancing
between
reason

insanity
,
in
that
cloud
which
is
neither
a

<UNK>
on
the

was
a
tall
man
,
of
a
dark
complexion

who
saw
with
<UNK>
eyes
that
they
were
approaching
a
dark
mass
of
land
in
the
shape
of
a
<UNK>
,
which
rose
from
the
midst
of
the
waves
like
the
hat
of
a
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
We
have
reached
it
!
''
A
few
minutes
afterwards
a
flash
of
light
,
which
was
extinguished
instantly
,
was
seen
on
the
land
,
and
the
sound
of
firearms
reached
the
yacht
.
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
as
if
awaking
from
a
dream
.
The
<UNK>
was
already
lowered
,
and
in
it
were
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
and
a

The

oars
fell
into
the
sea
simultaneously
without
<UNK>
a
drop
of
water
,
and
the
boat
,
yielding
to
the

,
glided
forward
.
``
Ah

your

murmured
the
pilot
,
``
you

our

``

Come

Yes

I
paid

<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
the

with
surprise

The

brow
became
clouded

``
You
are

happy

``
Then
you
are

My

would
be

not

suffer

No

giving

made

He
felt

surrounded

he
arose

<PROPER_NOUN>
obeyed
;
the

arose
,

<UNK>
a

with
a
key
suspended
from
his

took
from

a

beautifully

the

And
slowly

without

only
waiting

fervently

he
swallowed
the

Seated

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
watched

saw

Then
it
appeared

<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled

not
with
the

<UNK>

prostrate

breathless

he
became
unconscious

The

just
opened

he
mentally
ejaculated

his

uttered
no

as
though
all

centred
in

he
sighed

closed
his

became

lifting

shuddered
at
the

a

penetrated
the

recesses

his

his

met
those

The

felt
his

dilate

throb
;
he
opened
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
uttering
a

sprang
into
them

``

The

withdrew
for

throwing
his

around
the

he
pressed
the

D'Artagnan

This
permission

we
feel
bound

say

was
graciously
granted
;
which
compels
us
here
to
give
a
public
contradiction
to
the
<UNK>
who
pretend
that
we
live
under

moderately
indulgent

the

It

from

yellow
in

without

going

rendering

contrived

She
wept
abundantly
;
and
-
let
us
speak
it
to
the
praise
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
younger
-
notwithstanding
the
efforts
he
made
to
remain
firm
,
as
a
future
Musketeer
ought
,
nature
prevailed
,
and
he
shed
many
tears
,
of
which
he
succeeded
with
great
difficulty
in
concealing
the
half
.
It
was
not
that
the
sight
of
the
wretched
pony
did
not
excite
numerous
smiles
on
the
countenances
of
passers-by
;
but
as
against

rattled
a

and
as
over
this
sword
gleamed
an
eye
rather
ferocious

haughty
,
these

repressed
their
hilarity

hilarity
prevailed
over
prudence
,
they
endeavored
to
laugh
only
on
<NUMBER>
side

like
the

This

D'Artagnan
was
only
in
part
mistaken

he
himself
was
not
in
question

his

was

He
fixed
his

upon

perceived
a

with
black

eyes
,
pale
complexion
,

mustache
.
Now
,
as
at

fixed
his

upon

the

made

laughed
even

he
himself
,

allowed
a

smile
-LRB-
if
I
may
allowed
to
use
such
an

to
stray
over
his

``

The

looked
at
him
again
with
a
slight
smile
,
and
retiring
from
the
window
,
came
out
of
the
hostelry
with
a
slow
step
,
and
placed
himself
before
the
horse
,
within

of

``

``

more

This

from
the
attack
that
<PROPER_NOUN>

adversary
,
while
the

turned
round

sheathed

muttering
,
nevertheless

``
A

When

turning
round

announced
the
entrance

came
in
to
inquire

Perfectly

I

But
before

he

all

``
Then

The

rose
from

of

he
had
leaned
with

knitted

very

the

fell
into

lasted
some

Where

``
On

But
an
imperious

from

stopped
him
short
;
he
bowed
humbly
and
retired
.
I
should
like
,
however
,
to
know

In
the

,
the
host
,
who
entertained
no

that
it
was
the
presence
of
the
young

that
drove
the
stranger
from

hostelry

<UNK>
to
his

chamber
,
and
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
just
recovering
his
senses

We
have
already
observed
with
what
rapidity
D'Artagnan
seized
the
expression
of
a
countenance
.
``
His

the

knitting
his

And
bowing
to
the
lady
,
sprang
into
his
saddle
,
while
her
coachman
applied
his

vigorously
to
his
horses

``

Scarcely
had

gone

when
his

began
to
<UNK>

a

seized
him
,
a
cloud
of
blood
passed
over

and
he
fell
in
the
middle
of

street
,
crying
still
,
``

``
Yes

On

descending

This

This

brought
him
to

in

;
at

he
rose

in

repair
to
the
residence

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the

The

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
served
him
so
faithfully
in
his
wars
against
the

that
in

of
money
-
a
thing
to
which
the

was
accustomed
all
his

and
who
constantly
paid
his

with
that

he
never
stood
in

<UNK>
,
that
is
to

with
ready

-
in

we
repeat

he
authorized

after

to
assume
for

a
golden
lion
<UNK>
upon

,
with
the
motto
<UNK>
et

At
that
unhappy
period
it
was
an
important
consideration
to
be
surrounded
by
such
men
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
short
,
up
to
this
period
nothing
had
been
wanting
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
but
opportunity
;
but
he
was
ever
on
the
watch
for
it
,
and
he
faithfully
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
fail
to
seize
it
by
its
<NUMBER>
hairs
whenever
it
came
within
reach
of
his

.
He
had
his
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
therefore
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
his

and
these
<NUMBER>
powerful

<UNK>
with
each

in
procuring
,
not
only
from
all
the
provinces
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
but
even
from
all
foreign
states
,
the
most
celebrated
swordsmen
.
We
learn
this
from
the
memoirs
of
a
man
who
was
concerned
in
some
few
of
these
defeats
and
in
many
of
these
victories
.
His
soldiers
formed
a
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
fellows
,
perfectly
<UNK>
toward
all
but
himself
.
For
the
rest
,
in
the
memoirs
of
this
period
,
which
has
left
so
many
memoirs
,
<NUMBER>
does
not
find
this
worthy
gentleman
<UNK>
even
by
his
enemies
;
and
he
had
many
such
among
men
of
the
pen
as
well
as
among
men
of
the
sword
.
The
captain
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
therefore
admired
,
feared
,
and
loved
;
and
this
<UNK>
the
<UNK>
of
human
fortune
.
The
court
of
his
hotel
,
situated
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
resembled
a
camp
from
by
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
summer
and
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
winter
.
In
the
antechamber
,
upon
long
circular
benches
,
reposed
the
elect
;
that
is
to
say
,
those
who
were
called
.
When
he
had
once
passed
the
massive
door
covered
with
long
<UNK>
nails
,
he
fell
into
the
midst
of
a
troop
of
swordsmen
,
who
crossed
<NUMBER>
another
in
their
passage
,
calling
out
,
quarreling
,
and
playing
tricks
<NUMBER>
with
another
.
Arrived
at
the
staircase
,
it
was
still
worse
.
D'Artagnan
at
first
took
these
weapons
for
<UNK>
,
and
believed
them
to
be
buttoned
;
but
he
soon
perceived
by
certain
scratches
that
every
weapon
was
pointed
and
sharpened
,
and
that
at
each
of
these
scratches
not
only
the
spectators
,
but
even
the
actors
themselves
,
laughed
like
so
many
madmen
.
In
<NUMBER>
minutes
<NUMBER>
were
slightly
wounded
,
<NUMBER>
on
the
hand
,
another
on
the
ear
,
by
the
<UNK>
of
the
stair
,
who
himself
remained
intact
-
a
piece
of
skill
which
was
worth
to
him
,
according
to
the
rules
agreed
upon
,
<NUMBER>
turns
of
favor
,
However
difficult
it
might
be
,
or
rather
as
he
pretended
it
was
,
to
astonish
our
young
traveler
,
this
pastime
really
astonished
him
.
On
the
landing
D'Artagnan
blushed
;
in
the
antechamber
he
trembled
.
That
great
man
who
was
so
<UNK>
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
elder
served
as
an
object
of
ridicule
to
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
cracked
their
jokes
upon
his
<UNK>
legs
and
his
crooked
back
.
``
<UNK>
,
these
fellows
will
all
either
be
imprisoned
or
hanged
,
''
thought
the
terrified
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
I
,
no
doubt
,
with
them
;
for
from
the
moment
I
have
either
listened
to
or
heard
them
,
I
shall
be
held
as
an
accomplice
.
At
this
demand
<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
his
name
very
modestly
,
<UNK>
the
title
of
compatriot
,
and
begged
the
servant

had
put
the
question
to
him
to
request
a

audience

-
a
request
which
the

,
with
an

promised

A

crimson
velvet
fell
in
graceful

from

shoulders

<UNK>
in

the
splendid
baldric
,

was
suspended
a
gigantic

``
Ah

``
Yes

turning
toward
another

he
spoke
little

slowly

bowed
frequently

laughed
without
noise

showing
his

which
were
fine

of

the

he
appeared
to
take
great

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
significant

which
gave
to
this
sentence

apparently
so
simple

a
tolerably
scandalous
meaning

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
from
whose
usually
mild
eye
a
flash
passed
like
lightning
.

made
him
speak
thus
.
In
an
instant
,
from
the
door
of
the
cabinet
to
the
street
gate
,
the
whole
hotel
was
boiling
.
``
What
!
I
will
go
straight
to
the
<UNK>
;
I
will
give
in
my
resignation
as
captain
of
the
king
's
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
to
take
a
<UNK>
in
the
cardinal
's
Guards
,
and
if
he
refuses
me
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
D'Artagnan
looked
for
some
tapestry
behind
which
he
might
hide
himself
,
and
felt
an
immense
inclination
to
<UNK>
under
the
table
.
Well
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
endeavored
twice
to
get
up
,
and
fell
again
twice
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
they
believed
him
to
be
dead
,
and
left
him
very
quiet
on
the
field
of
battle
,
not
thinking
it
worth
the
trouble
to
carry
him
away
.
``
And
I
have
the
honor
of
assuring
you
that
I
killed
<NUMBER>
of
them
with
his
own
sword

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
for
mine
was
broken
at
the
first
parry
.
``
But
pray
,
sir
,
''
continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
seeing
his
captain
become
appeased
,
ventured
to
risk
a
prayer
,
``
do
not
say
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
is
wounded
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
And
at
these
words
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
irreproachable
costume
,
<UNK>
as
usual
,
with
a
tolerably
firm
step
,
entered
the
cabinet
.
And
without
waiting
for
the
answer
of
the
newcomer
to
this
proof
of
affection
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
seized
his
right
hand
and
pressed
it
with
all
his
might
,
without
perceiving
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whatever
might
be
his
self-command
,
allowed
a
slight
murmur
of
pain
to
escape
him
,
and
if
possible
,
grew
paler
than
he
was
before
.
``
A
surgeon
!
''
A
surgeon
!
He
pushed
through
the
crowd
,
approached
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
still
insensible
,
and
as
all
this
noise
and
commotion
inconvenienced
him
greatly
,
he
required
,
as
the
first
and
most
urgent
thing
,
that
the
Musketeer
should
be
carried
into
an
adjoining
chamber
.
<UNK>
spoke
,
<UNK>
,
and
vociferated
,
swearing
,
cursing
,
and
<UNK>
the
cardinal
and
his
Guards
to
all
the
devils
.
The
surgeon
declared
that
the
situation
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
nothing
in
it
to
render
his
friends
uneasy
,
his
weakness
having
been
purely
and
simply
caused
by
loss
of
blood
.
He
inquired
what
was
the
will
of
his
<UNK>
visitor
.
A
captain
is
nothing
but
a
father
of
a
family
,
charged
with
even
a
greater
responsibility
than
the
father
of
an
ordinary
family
.
``
What
can
I
do
for
the
son
?
But
his
majesty
's
decision
is
always
necessary
;
and
I
inform
you
with
regret
that
no
one
becomes
a
Musketeer
without
the
preliminary
<UNK>
of
several
campaigns

certain
brilliant
actions
,
or
a

you

not

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
bearing
became
still
more
imposing
.
Do
not
refuse
this

service
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
stranger
as
he
was
to
all
the
manners
of
a
court
,
could
not
but
perceive
a
little
coldness
in
this
reception
.
He
then
related
the
adventure
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
described
the
unknown
gentleman
with
the
greatest
<UNK>
,
and
all
with
a
warmth
and
<UNK>
that
delighted
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
if
I
should
not
put
myself
under
its
protection

''
``
Was
he
not
a
<UNK>
man
?
''
``
Of
complexion
and
brown

?
''
``
He
departed
immediately
after
having
conversed
for
a
minute
with
her
whom
he
awaited
.

``
He
called
her

''
``
Oh

if
you

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
tell

``

All
at
once
the
captain
stopped
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
suspicion
.
This
pretended
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
was
he
not
an
emissary
of
the
cardinal
,
whom
the
cardinal
sought
to
introduce
into
<PROPER_NOUN>

house
,
to
place
near

to
win
his
confidence
,
and
afterward
to

him

had
been
done
in
a
<NUMBER>
other

Let
us
try
him
.
''
Be
assured
that
I
am
devoted
to
both
these
all-powerful
masters
,
and
that
my
earnest
endeavors
have
no
other
aim
than
the
service
of
the
king
,
and
also
the
cardinal
-
<NUMBER>
of
the
most
illustrious
<UNK>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
ever
produced
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
said
to
himself
:
``
If
the
cardinal
has
set
this

upon

he
will
certainly
not

he

how
bitterly
I
<UNK>
him
-
to
tell
his
spy
that
the
best
means
of
making
his
court
to
me
is
to
rail
at

.
My
father
advised
me
to
stoop
to
nobody
but
the
king
,
the
cardinal
,
and
yourself
-
whom
he
considered
the
first
<NUMBER>
personages
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
''
But
I
still
trust
you
will
not
esteem
me
the

it

and
that
is
my
object
beyond
all
others

My
hotel
will
be
always
open
to
you

And
he
bowed
in
order
to
retire
,
and
as
if
he
considered
the
future
in
his
own
hands
.
``
No
,
sir

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

I

But
at
the
very
moment
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
stretched
out
his
hand
to
receive
it
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
highly
astonished
to
see
his
protege
make
a
sudden
spring
,
become
crimson
with
passion
,
and
rush
from
the
cabinet
crying
,
``
S'blood
,
he
shall
not
escape
me
this

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
unless

''
added
he
,
``
this
is
a

``
You

Excuse

and
you
believe
that
is

``
My

I
repeat
to
you
,
however
,
and
this

on
my

of
honor

I
think
perhaps
too
often

that

great

``
<PROPER_NOUN>

If

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
At

''
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
But
at
the
street
gate
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
talking
with
the
soldier
on
guard
.
As
he
was
about
to
pass
,
the
wind
blew
out
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
long
cloak
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
straight
into
the
middle
of
it
.
Alas
,
like
most
things
in
this
world
which
have
nothing
in
their
favor
but
appearances
,
the
baldric
was
glittering
with
gold
in
the
front
,
but
was
nothing
but
simple
buff
behind
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
making
strong
efforts
to
<UNK>
himself
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
<UNK>
about
his
back
;
``
you
must
be
mad

run
against

in
this
manner

''
Whether
<PROPER_NOUN>
understood
him
or
did
not
understand
him
,
giving
way
to
his
anger
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
stand
a
chance
of
getting
<UNK>
if
you
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
in
this
fashion
.
''
``
Ah
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
``
Presently
,
presently
,
''
cried
the
latter
,
``
when
you
have
n't
your
cloak
on

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
inquired
of
everyone
he
met
with
,
went
down
to
the
ferry
,
came
up
again
by
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
but
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
!
Besides
this
,
he
had
drawn
upon
himself
<NUMBER>
good
duels
with
<NUMBER>
men
,
each
capable
of
killing
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
in
short
,
with
<NUMBER>
of
those
beings
whom
he
esteemed
so
greatly
that
he
placed
them
in
his
mind
and
heart
above
all
other
men
.
That
brave
and
unfortunate
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
wounded
on
that
very
shoulder
against
which
I
must
run
head
foremost
,
like
a
<UNK>
.
And
in
spite
of
himself
,
the
young
man
began
to
laugh
aloud
,
looking
round
carefully
,
however
,
to
see
that
his
solitary
laugh
,
without
a
cause
in
the
eyes
of
passers-by
,
offended
no

.
And
have
I
any
right
to
go
and
peep
under
their
cloaks
to
see
what
is
not
there
?
You
must
henceforth
be
admired
and
<UNK>
as
a

No
,
certainly
not
,
and
from
this

I
will
endeavor
to
model
myself
after
him

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
walking
and
<UNK>
,
had
arrived
within
a
few
steps
of
the
hotel
<UNK>
and
in
front
of
that
hotel
perceived
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
chatting
gaily
with
<NUMBER>
gentlemen
;
but
as
he
had
not
forgotten
that
it

in

this

that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

He

seeking
in

then
,
for
the

awkward
means
of
retreat

when
he
remarked
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
let
his

fall

by
mistake

no

had
placed

<PROPER_NOUN>
blushed
excessively
,
and
snatched
rather
than
took
the

from

hand
of
the

Then
,
resuming
his
mild
air
,
``
You

said
he
,
``

without
a

determined
to
be
satisfied

those

from

He

He

when

the

He

His

then
shrugged

He
talked

<PROPER_NOUN>
consoled
himself
by

<PROPER_NOUN>
and

with

there
was

He

Thanks

entertained

he

badly
with

But
he

no

He

With

I
was

up
in

he

At

he

thought

He
went

The

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

promised
this

a

In

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
like
all
other

and
after
this

our

began

Then
,
as

they

recourse

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

all

As

D'Artagnan
awakened

rushed

it

At

a

The

But
this

From

<PROPER_NOUN>
held

was

<PROPER_NOUN>
flew

laid

gently
down
from

A

those

closed

close

he

at

recognized

seen
on

It
may
be
judged
whether

looked
or

with

She
made
her
interlocutor
observe
the
corner
of
this
unfolded
object
.
We
say
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
because
the
young
man
entertained
no
doubt
that
it
was
his
friend
who
held
this
dialogue
from
the
interior
with
the
lady
of
the
exterior
.
At
the
same
instant
the
woman
inside
drew
a
second
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
,
and
exchanged
it
for
that
which
had
just
been
shown
to
her
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
But
was
it
on
her
own
account
,
or
on
account
of
another
,
that
she
exposed
herself
to
such
<UNK>
?
But
at
the
sight
of
the
young
man
,
who
detached
himself
from
the
wall
like
a
statue
walking
from
its
niche
,
and
at
the
noise
of
the
steps
which
she
heard
resound
behind
her
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
uttered
a
little
cry
and
fled
.
The
unfortunate
woman
was
exhausted
,
not
by
fatigue
,
but
by
terror
,
and
when
<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
,
she
sank
upon

knee
,
crying
in
a

,
``
Kill

``

offered
his

willingly
took
it

half
laughing

both
gained
the

It
was
necessary
to
reach
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
it
was
important
that
he
should
be
informed
of
what

He
had
at

an

crossing

but
on
gaining
the
<UNK>

he
had
mechanically
put
his

into
his

and
perceived
that

had
not
wherewithal

pay
his
passage

Besides
,
the

wore
that

which
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
still

on

on

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
still
further
,
the

wore
the
uniform

a
Musketeer
.
That
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
road
,
as
he
was
going

the

He
felt
himself
doubly
betrayed

by
his

by

whom
he
already
loved
like
a

<UNK>
and
anger
mounted
to
his
face
;
he
was
resolved
to
unravel
the
mystery
.
Which
was
illuminated
by
a
lamp
which
threw
its
light
over
all
that
part
of
the
bridge
.
``
It
is
not

''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
With

I
hoped

The
<PROPER_NOUN>
advanced
<NUMBER>
steps
,
and
pushed
<PROPER_NOUN>
aside
with
his
hand
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
throwing
herself
between
the
combatants
and
seizing
the
swords
with
her
hands
.
``

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
holding
out
his
hand
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
pressed
it
respectfully
.
As
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
immediately
repaired
to
the
cabaret
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
he
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
awaiting
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
known
to
belong
to
the
queen
;
the
duke
wore
the
uniform
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
were
that
evening
on
guard
.
Once
within
the
interior
of
the
court
,
the
duke
and
the
young
woman
followed
the
wall
for
the
space
of
about
<UNK>
steps
.
She
closed
the
door
after
her
,
took
the
duke
by
the
hand
,
and
after
a
few
<UNK>
steps
,
grasped
a
balustrade
,
put
her
foot
upon
the
bottom
step
,
and
began
to
ascend
the
staircase
.
Nevertheless
,
isolated
as
he
was
,
we
must
say
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
experience
an
instant
of
fear
.
The
queen
had
at
first
positively
refused
;
but
at
length
became
afraid
that
the
duke
,
if
exasperated
,
would
commit
some
folly
.
His
Musketeer
's
uniform
became
him
marvelously
.
It
was
thus
he
had
succeeded
in
approaching
several
times
the
beautiful
and
proud
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
in
making
himself
loved
by
dazzling
her
.
It
was
the
queen
!
Her
skin
was
admired
for
its
<UNK>
<UNK>
;
her
hands
and
arms
were
of
surpassing
beauty
,
all
the
poets
of
the
time
singing
them
as
incomparable
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
<NUMBER>
steps
forward
.
Yes
,
your
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
Besides
,
I
have
lost
nothing
by
this
journey
because
I
see
you
.
''
In
short
,
I
see
you
to
tell
you
that
we
must
never
see
each
other
again
.
''
``
My
Lord
,
''
cried
the
queen
,
``
you
forget
that
I
have
never
said
that
I
love
you
.
''
<PROPER_NOUN>
I
tell
you
each
ornament
of
your
toilet
?
You
wore
a
close
<UNK>
,
a
small
cap
upon
your
head
of
the
same
color
as
your
robe
,
and
in
that
cap
a

feather
.
``
What
folly

''
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
not
the
courage
to
find
fault
with
the
duke
for
having
so
well
preserved
her
portrait
in
his
heart
,
``
what
folly
to
feed
a

passion

Every

I
see
you
is
a
fresh
diamond
which
I
enclose
in
the
casket
of
my

That
is
the
most
happy
and
brilliant
evening
of
my

Then
you
were
about

tell

all

the

``
My

no

perhaps
folly

overcome

re-entered
her

came
out

At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
thereabouts
,
a
clerk
came
to
put
an
end
to
his
tortures
,
but
not
to
his
anxiety
,
by
giving
the
order
to
conduct

<PROPER_NOUN>
to

The

led
the

toward

table
,
and
upon
a
sign
from
the
commissary
drew
back
so
far
as
to
be
unable
to
hear
anything
.
He
began
by
asking
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
his
name

age

condition
,
and
abode

After
this
second
part
of
his

fixing
his

eye
upon
poor

he
bade
him
reflect
upon
the
gravity

situation

<PROPER_NOUN>
indeed
reflected
on
what
had
just
been
said
to
him

``

She

the

himself

``

But
that
is
not
an

''
And
he
followed
the
guards
who
came
for
him
,
mechanically
and
without
resistance
.
Through
the
closely
fastened
windows
the
prisoner
could
perceive
the
houses
and
the
pavement
,
that
was
all
;
but
,
true
Parisian
as
he
was
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
recognize
every
street
by
the
<UNK>
,
the
signs
,
and
the
lamps

<UNK>
on
,
a
still
greater
terror
seized
him
on
passing
by
the
cemetery
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
state
criminals
were
buried
.
This
measure
somewhat
reassured
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
time
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
;
it
was
at
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
<UNK>
that
<UNK>
criminals
were
executed
.
This
was
more
than
poor
Bonacieux
could
endure
,
depressed
as
he
was
by
the
successive
emotions
which
he
had
experienced
;
he
uttered
a
feeble
groan
which
night
have
been
taken
for
the
last
sigh
of
a
dying
man
,
and
fainted
.
They
carried
him
through
an
alley
,
up
a
flight
of
stairs
,
and
deposited
him
in
an
antechamber
.
He
remained
on
the
bench
,
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
wall
and
his
hands
hanging
down
,
exactly
on
the
spot
where
the
guards
placed
him
.
At
this
moment
an
officer
with
a
pleasant
face
opened
a
door
,
continued
to
exchange
some
words
with
a
person
in
the
next
chamber
and
then
came
up
to
the
prisoner
.
``
Come
in

said
the
officer
.
A
square
table

covered
with
books

upon

was
unrolled
an
immense
plan
of

not
such

is

broken
down
like
an

,
suffering
like
a
martyr
,
his
body
bent
,
his
voice
failing
,
buried
in
a
large
armchair
as
in
an
anticipated
tomb
;
no
longer
living
but
by
the
strength
of
his
genius
,
and
no

<UNK>
the
struggle
with

but
by
the
eternal
application

his

-

such

really

at
this
period
;
that
is
to

,
an
active

gallant
cavalier
,
already
weak

asked
he
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
.
The
officer
took
from
the
table
the
papers
pointed
out
,
gave
them
to
him
who
asked
for
them
,
bowed
to
the
ground
,
and
retired
.
``

he

And
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
opening
the

communication
,
passed
into
the
corridor
which
led
from
his
apartments
to
those
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

These
thoughts
,
gilded
as
they
were
by
a
last
reflection
of
love

were
not
the
less
sad
.

were
exiled

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
conceal
from
his

he
expected
to
be
arrested
every

As
to
the
king
,
he
made
no
demonstration
of
politeness
,
only
stopping
before
the
queen
.
The
king
turned
upon
his
heel
without
reply
,
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
captain
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
announced
the
visit
of
the
chancellor
.
This
chancellor
was
a
pleasant
man
.
After
a
wild
youth
,
he
had
retired
into
a
convent
,
there
to
<UNK>
,
at

for
some
time
,
the
follies

<UNK>

This
advice
appeared
good
to
the
future
chancellor

The
monks
had
no
longer
an
instant
of
repose
.
The
queen
was
still
standing
when
he
entered
;
but
scarcely
had
she
perceived
him
then
she
reseated
herself
in
her
armchair
,
and
made
a
sign
to
her
women
to
resume
their
cushions
and
stools
,
and
with
an
air
of
supreme
hauteur
,
said
,
``

cried
the

in

the
imperious
blood
of

began
to
rise
.
The
commission
might
well
be
called
delicate
;
and
the

had
reached
,
in
his
jealousy
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
point
of
not

with

The

looked

he
read

rapidly

The

went

said
he
,

<PROPER_NOUN>
the

,
hearing
the
clock
strike
eleven
,
bowed
low
,
asking
permission
of
the
king
to
retire
,
and
supplicating
him
to
come
to
a

with

The

took
advantage
of
this

to
tell
her
that

the
intention
of
shortly
giving

<NUMBER>

Richelieu
counted
on

In

had
wounded

exclaiming
at

him
to

was

and
whom
he

leaving

he
gave
a

to
destroy

``
Now

<PROPER_NOUN>
,

bind

``
Oh

that

Delighted
with
this

the
governor
<UNK>
the
passport
and
delivered
it
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
vessel
was
quite
ready
to
sail
,
and
the

was
waiting
on
the

And
that

He
leaped

into

<NUMBER>

after
they
were
on
board

Fortunately
,
as
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
thought
,
it
was
not

A

was
laid
upon

deck
for

At

the

cast

D'Artagnan

<PROPER_NOUN>
galloped
off
,
reached
the

and
announced
to

in

that

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the

he
came
up

throwing
all
his

into
the
question

``
What

it

``
This

<PROPER_NOUN>

becoming

feared

would
faint
as

broke
the
seal

``
You
are

cried
the
duke
.
As
they
rode
along
,
the
duke
endeavored
to
draw
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
not
all
that
had
happened
,
but
what
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
knew
.
While
he
was
listening
to
this
recital
,
delivered
with
the
greatest
simplicity
,
the
duke
looked
from
time
to
time
at
the
young

with
astonishment
,
as
if
he
could
not
comprehend
how
so
much
prudence

be

did

The

The

He
wished
to
have
the

at

not

at

mistrusted

for

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed

made
his

as
quickly
as
possible

The
next
day
about
<NUMBER>
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
landed
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
host
instantly
made
him
a
sign
to
follow
,
went
out
with
him
by
a
door
which
opened
into
a
yard
,
led
him
to
the
stable

where
a
saddled
horse
awaited

asked

stood

``

``
Amen

At
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
as
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
found
a
horse
quite
ready
and
awaiting
him
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
replied
the
questioner
.
You
must
stop
at
the
little
village

the

``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
master

At
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
the
same
scene
was
repeated
.
He
had
made
nearly
<NUMBER>
leagues
in
little
more
than
<NUMBER>
hours
.
The
city
<UNK>
had
erected
<UNK>
upon
which
the
invited
ladies
were
to
be
placed
;
the
city
grocer
had
ornamented
the
chambers
with
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
<PROPER_NOUN>
if
white
wax
,
a
piece
of
luxury
unheard
of
at
that
period
;
and
<NUMBER>
violins
were
ordered
,
and
the
price
for
them
fixed
at
double
the
usual
rate
,
upon
condition
,
said
the
report
,
that
they
should
be
played
all
night
.
At
eleven
o'clock
came
in
his
turn
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
captain
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
bringing
with
him
<NUMBER>
archers
,
who
were
distributed
immediately
through
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>

at
the
doors
assigned
them
.
As
fast
as
they
entered
,
they
were
placed
in
the
grand
saloon
,
on
the
<UNK>
prepared
for
them
.
At
midnight
great
cries
and
loud
acclamations
were
heard
.
Everybody
noticed
that
the
king
looked
dull
and
preoccupied
.
The
nobles
and
ladies
of
their
<PROPER_NOUN>
'
<UNK>
were
to
dress
,
<NUMBER>
by
<NUMBER>
,
in
chambers
prepared
for
the
purpose
.
The
queen
entered
the
great
hall
;
and
it
was
remarked
that
,
like
the
king
,
she
looked
dull
and
even
weary
.
All
at
once
the
king
appeared
with
the
cardinal
at
<NUMBER>
of
the
doors
of
the
hall
.
The
queen
cast
a
glance
around
her
,
and
saw
the
cardinal
behind
,
with
a
diabolical
smile
on
his
countenance
.
I
tell
you
that
you
were
wrong
.
''
``
Do
so
,
madame
,
do
so
,
and
that
at
once
;
for
within
an
hour
the
ballet
will
commence
.
''
Everybody
had
remarked
that
something
had
passed
between
the
king
and
queen
;
but
both
of
them
had
spoken
so
low
that
everybody
,
out
of
respect
,
withdrew
several
steps
,
so
that
nobody
had
heard
anything
.
This
was
the
costume
that
best
became
the
king
.
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
If
the
king
appeared
to
be
the
first
gentleman
of
his
kingdom
,
the
queen
was
without
doubt
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
king
trembled
with
joy
and
the
cardinal
with
vexation
;
although
,
distant
as
they
were
from
the
queen
,
they
could
not
count
the
studs
.
The
king
advanced
toward
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
whom
he
was
to
dance
,
and
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
with
the
queen
.
The
ballet
lasted
an
hour
,
and
had
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
.
``
How
,
sire
?
''
``
What
does
this
mean
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
Then
saluting
the
king
and
the
cardinal
,
the
queen
resumed
her
way
to
the
chamber
in
which
she
had
dressed
,
and
where
she
was
to
take
off
her
costume
.
The
face
of
this
young
woman
was
covered
with
a
black
velvet
mask
;
but
notwithstanding
this
precaution
,
which
was
in
fact
taken
rather
against
others
than
against
him
,
he
at
once
recognized
his
usual
guide
,
the
light
and
intelligent
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
All
the
way
,
and
in
proportion
as
the
corridors
became
more
deserted
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
wished
to
stop
the
young
woman
,
seize
her
and
gaze
upon
her
,
were
it
only
for
a
minute
;
but
quick
as
a
bird
she
glided
between
his
hands
,
and
when
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
,
her
finger
placed
upon
her
mouth
,
with
a
little
imperative
gesture
full
of
grace
,
reminded
him
that
he
was
under
the
command
of
a
power
which
he
must
blindly
obey
,
and
which
forbade
him
even
to
make
the
slightest
complaint
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
for
a
moment
motionless
,
asking
himself
where
he
could
be
;
but
soon
a
ray
of
light
which
penetrated
through
the
chamber
,
together
with
the
warm
and
perfumed
air
which
reached
him
from
the
same
aperture
,
the
conversation
of
<NUMBER>
of
<NUMBER>
ladies
in
language
at
once
respectful
and
refined
,
and
the
word
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
''
several
times
repeated
,
indicated
clearly
that
he
was
in
a
closet
attached
to
the
queen
's
apartment
.
Although
D'Artagnan
did
not
at
all
know
the
queen
,
he
soon
distinguished
her
voice
from
the
others
,
at
first
by
a
slightly
foreign
accent
,
and
next
by
that
tone
of
<UNK>
naturally
impressed
upon
all
royal
words
.
He
cast
himself
on
his
knees
,
seized
the
hand
,
and
touched
it
respectfully
with
his
lips
.
After
the
reward
of
his
devotion
,
that
of
his
love
was
to
come
.
The
company
was
then
heard
departing
;
then
the
door
of
the
closet
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
,
was
opened
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
.
said
the
young
woman
,
placing
her
hand
upon
his
lips
;
``
silence
,
and
go
the
same
way
you
came
!
''
Begone
,
begone
!
''
<UNK>
knows
that
<UNK>
and
lovers
have
a
protecting
<UNK>
.
when
he
was
left
``
stiff
as
a
rush
''
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
No
one
has
<UNK>
a

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
but

come
of
itself

''
``
I
left
it
where
I
found
it

monsieur

Meanwhile
,
the
young
man
had
darted
in
to
his
chamber
,
and
opened
the
letter
.
It
was
the
first
billet
he
had
received
;
it
was
the
first
rendezvous
that
had
been
granted
him
.
``
You
are
mistaken

''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
and
as
a
proof
,
there
is
a

drink
my
health

''
``
My

''
But
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
that
letter
-
''
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
retired
,
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
doubt
,
which
the
liberality
of

As

<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
from

threw
the
bridle
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
departed
at
a
quick
pace
,
folding
his

around
him
.
It
was
situated
in
a
very
private
spot
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
leaned
against
the
hedge
,
after
having
cast
a
glance
behind
it
.
In
fact
,
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
the
belfry
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
let
fall
slowly
then
strokes
from
its
sonorous
jaws
.
There
could
be
no

that
behind
this
little
window
,
which
threw
forth
such
friendly
beams
,
the
pretty
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
expected
him
.
Perhaps
the
cold
began
to
affect
him
,
and
he
took
a
perfectly
physical
sensation
for
a
moral
impression
.
<NUMBER>
o'clock
sounded
.
He
approached
the
wall
,
and
tried
to
climb
it
;
but
the
wall
had
been
recently
pointed
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
could
get
no
hold
.
In
an
instant
he
was
among
the
branches
,
and
his
keen
eyes
plunged
through
the
transparent
panes
into
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
.
The
<UNK>
broken
in
pieces
,
and
the
fruits
crushed
,
strewed
the
floor
.
The
little
soft
light
shone
on
in
the
calmness
of
the
night
.
This
glove
,
wherever
it
had
not
touched
the
muddy
ground
,
was
of
irreproachable
odor
.
But
all
these
reasons
were
combated
,
destroyed
,
<UNK>
,
by
that
feeling
of
intimate
pain
which
,
on
certain
occasions
,
takes
possession
of
our
being
,
and
cries
to
us
so
as
to
be
understood
<UNK>
that
some
great
misfortune
is
hanging
over
us
.
There
were
then
,
as
now
,
a
crowd
of
young
and
pretty
women
who
came
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
who
had
reasons
for
not
being
seen
,
and
yet
D'Artagnan
did
not
for
an
instant
doubt
that
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
whom
the
boatman
had
noticed
.
It
appeared
to
him
that
something
might
have
happened
at
the
pavilion
in
his
absence
,
and
that
fresh
information
awaited
him
.
No
one
answered
to
his
first
knocking
.
At
length
an
old
,
worm-eaten
shutter
was
opened
,
or
rather
pushed
ajar
,
but
closed
again
as
soon
as
the
light
from
a
miserable
lamp
which
burned
in
the
corner
had
shone
upon
the
baldric
,
sword
belt
,
and
pistol
<UNK>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
I
am
dying
with
anxiety
.
D'Artagnan
related
his
story
simply
,
with
the
<UNK>
of
names
.
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
You
have

then

seen

As
I
am
very

I
went

opened

at

from

Immediately
,
he
who
had
spoken
to
me
approached
the
door
of
the
pavilion
,
opened
it
with
a
key
he
had
in
his
hand
,
closed
the
door
and
disappeared
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
other
<NUMBER>
men
ascended
the
ladder
.
The
woman
screamed
,
and
cried
for
help
;
but
her
cries
were
soon
stifled
.
He
sprang
into
his
saddle
;
the
lackey
took
his
place
by
the
coachman
;
the
carriage
went
off
at
a
quick
pace
,
escorted
by
the
<NUMBER>
horsemen
,
and
all
was
over
.
``
Can
you
guess
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
who
was
the
man
who
headed
this
infernal
expedition
?

``
Exactly
so

He
is
my

apparently

``
Oh

was
not

I
'll
answer

it

did
not

and
the

treated
him
with
small
consideration
.
''
said
the
old
man
.
With
a
heavy
heart
,
D'Artagnan
again
bent
his
way
toward
the
ferry
.
It
was
past
midnight
;
the
next
thing
was
to
find

Besides

it
came
into
the

mind
that

remaining
in
the
environs

the
spot
on
which
this
sad
event
had
passed
,
he
would
,
perhaps
,
have
some
light
thrown
upon
the
mysterious
affair

Toward
<NUMBER>
o'clock
D'Artagnan
awoke
with
that
uncomfortable
feeling
which
generally
<UNK>
the
break
of
day
after

Instead

returning
directly
home

<PROPER_NOUN>
alighted
at
the
door
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
to
the
young
man
's
account
with
a
seriousness
which
proved
that
he
saw
something
else
in
this
adventure
besides
a
love
affair
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Rely
on
me

''
On
approaching
the
house
,
he
perceived
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
morning
costume
,
standing
at
his
threshold
.
All

however

made
the

may
be

with

we

o'clock
in
the

!
It

he
has
no

happiness
elsewhere

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

Both
were
stained
with

inclination
seized
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
grasp

by

and
strangle
him
;
but
,
as
we
have

he

what

ceremoniously

<PROPER_NOUN>
frowned
slightly
;
a
scarcely

cloud
passed
over
her

,
and
so
peculiar
a
smile
appeared
upon
her
lips
that
the

who
saw

observed
this

almost
shuddered
at
it

<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
with

it

to
be
perceived

whatever

she
made

conceal
her
impressions

that
this

was
not

He
filled
<NUMBER>
glasses
,
and
by
a
sign
invited
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
drink

Now
that

believed
herself

observed

resembling
ferocity
animated

exchanged
a
shake

returned

Milady
appeared
to
have
entirely
recovered

All
this
showed
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
there
was
a
veil
which
concealed
something
;
but
he
could
not
yet
see
under
this
veil
.
The
hour
came
for
him
to
retire
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
at
home
;
and
it
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
this
time
did
all
the
honors
of
the
evening
.
Milady
changed
the
conversation
without
any
appearance

affectation
,
and
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
the
most
careless
manner
possible
if

In

corridor
he
again
met

But
,
as
we
have
said

<PROPER_NOUN>
paid
no
attention

this
persistence

poor
<PROPER_NOUN>

No

a

material
interest
stirred
his
blood
.
To
come
in
the
capacity

seat
himself
every

at

table
;
to
smooth
the
yellow

pluck
the

a

by

them

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

by

for
the
lesson

would
give
them
in
an

their
savings
of

all
this
was
enormously
delightful
to

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knocked
with
his
hand
.
Although
the
Musketeer
was
not
expected
before
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
the
procurator
's
wife
had
been
on
the
watch
ever
since
midday
,
reckoning
that
the
heart
,
or
perhaps
the
stomach
,
of
her
lover
would
bring
him
before
his
time

cried
the
procurator
's
wife
.
This
last
apartment
was
a
sort
of
dark
room
,
<UNK>
with
papers
.
Then
,
while
passing
,
he
had
cast
a
rapid
,
<UNK>
glance
into
the
kitchen
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
,
to
the
shame
of
the
procurator
's
wife
and
his
own
regret
,
that
he
did
not
see
that
fire
,
that
animation
,
that
bustle
,
which
when
a
good
repast
is
on
foot
<UNK>
generally
in
that
<UNK>
of
good
living
.
The
old
man
,
wrapped
in
a
large
black
doublet
,
in
which
the
whole
of
his
slender
body
was
concealed
,
was
<UNK>
and
dry
.
The
cousin
was
received
with
resignation
,
that
was
all
.
said
the
procurator
,
maliciously
.
Porthos
comprehended
that
this
chest
,
although
it
did
not
correspond
in
shape
with
that
which
he
had
seen
in
his
dreams
,
must
be
the
blessed
coffer
,
and
he
congratulated
himself
that
the
reality
was
several
feet
higher
than
the
dream
.
``
Oh
,
my
legs
,
my
poor
legs
!
The
hour
of
dinner
soon
arrived
.
``
Indeed

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
,
pushed
along
upon
his
armchair
with
<UNK>
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
assisted
in
rolling
her
husband
up
to
the
table
.
``
What
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
can
they
smell
so
extraordinary
in
this
soup
?
''
Afterward
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
filled
her
own
plate
,
and
distributed
the
crusts
without
soup
to
the
impatient
clerks
.
``
You
are
certainly
treating
your
cousin
very
<UNK>
!
''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
``
this
is
poor
work
.
In
the
place
of
the
fowl
a
dish
of
<UNK>
beans
made
its
appearance
-
an
enormous
dish
in
which
some
bones
of
mutton
that
at
first
sight
one
might
have
believed
to
have
some
meat
on
them
pretended
to
show
themselves
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
poured
from
a
very
small
stone
bottle
the
third
of
a
glass
for
each
of
the
young
men
,
served
himself
in
about
the
same
proportion
,
and
passed
the
bottle
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
also
drank
half
a
glass
of
this
<UNK>
served
wine
,
and
found
it
to
be
nothing
but
that
horrible
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
the
terror
of
all
expert
<UNK>
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
take
me
if
I
taste

The
procurator
repeated
several
times
,
``
Ah

!
<PROPER_NOUN>
fancied
they
were

him
,
and
began
to
curl
his
mustache
and
knit
his
eyebrows
;
but
the
knee
of

<PROPER_NOUN>
gently
advised
him

promote

said
the
procurator
,
gravely
.
He
looked
to
see
if
the
dish
of
beans
was
still
there
;
the
dish
of
beans
had
disappeared
.
Porthos
looked
at
the
bottle
,
which
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
him
,
and
hoped
that
with
wine
,
bread
,
and
cheese
,
he
might
make
a
dinner
;
but
wine
was
wanting
,
the
bottle
was
empty
.
He
passed
his
tongue
over
a
spoonful
of
preserves
,
and
stuck
his
teeth
into
the
<UNK>
pastry
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
the
luxuries
of
such
a
repast
,
which
he
called
an
excess
,
felt
the
want
of
a
<UNK>

``
Thanks

``
But
of
what

then

''
``

said
she
.
``
Good
God

''
``
I
wished
to
know
the
detail

''
said
she
,
``

I

almost
sure

Thus
,
for
instance
,
do
n't
you
in
the
first
place
want
a
horse
?
''
``
Ah

<PROPER_NOUN>
smiled
.
As
to
my

it
is
useless

trouble
you

<PROPER_NOUN>

haughtily
;

added
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

uttered
fresh
sighs

These
conditions
being
agreed
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
leave
of

Thus
he
never
failed
to
pay
his
<UNK>
court
to
her
;
and
the
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
convinced
that
sooner

she
could
not
fail

respond

And
he
looked
down
at
the
pretty

with
the
most
triumphant

imaginable

Impossible

timidly

<PROPER_NOUN>
drew
a

from

For

``
Read
the

warmly

D'Artagnan
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
the
second
time
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
it
is
not
me

Then
only
<PROPER_NOUN>
remembered
the
languishing
glances
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
her
constantly
meeting
him
in
the
antechamber
,
the
corridor
,
or
on
the
stairs
,
those
touches
of
the
hand
every
time
she
met
him
,
and
her
deep
sighs
;
but
absorbed
by
his
desire
to
please
the
great
lady
,
he
had
disdained
the
<UNK>
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
to
the
young

,
``

you
willing

``
And
what
is

And
he
did
tell
her
so
much

and
so
well
,
that
the
poor

who
asked
nothing
better

did
believe
him

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>

And
<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
the
door

communication
opened
violently
.
She
was
at
length
appeased
,
and
the
conversation
turned
upon
him
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
assisting
her
mistress

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

heard
the

close

the
noise
of

fastened

``
Or
,
at

I

go

It
was
a
movement
of
vengeance
upon
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
As
to
the
cause
which
was
near
making
<PROPER_NOUN>
lose
her
credit
with
the
cardinal
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
nothing
about
it
;
but
this
time
D'Artagnan
was
better
informed
than
she
was
.
Kitty
came
in
,
but
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
very
cross
with
her
.
He
found
<PROPER_NOUN>
at
the
gate
,
and
,
as
on
the
preceding
evening
,
went
up
to
her
chamber
.
The
poor
girl
promised
all
her
lover
desired
;
she
was
mad
.
At
eleven
o'clock
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
to
him
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
:
This
is
the
third
time
I
have
written
to
you
to
tell
you
that
I
love
you
.
``
Oh
,
you
love

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
not
taken
her
eyes
off
the
young

countenance
for
an

.

told
me
that

``
By
the
scorn
I
will
throw

I
will
come
and
ask
mine

this

Besides
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
from
her
own
admission
knew
Milady
culpable
of
treachery
in
matters
more
important
,
and
could
entertain
no
respect
for
her
.
He
would
take
advantage
of
the
first
moment
of
surprise
,
shame
,
and
terror
,
to
triumph
over
her
.
It
is
the
count

reply

<PROPER_NOUN>
will
then
turn
you
out
of
doors

you
know
she
is
not
the

to
limit
her
vengeance
.
``
But
I
am
grateful
,
I
swear
to
you
.
''
cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
I
am
very
wretched

''
Finally
he
promised
that
he
would
leave
her
mistress
's
presence
at
an
early
hour
that
evening
,
and
that
when
he
left
the
mistress
he
would
ascend
with
the
maid
.
<UNK>
likewise
on
its
part
took
a
portion
of
that
precious
time
which
was
gliding
away
so
rapidly
-
only
they
had
agreed
to
meet
once
a

,
about
<NUMBER>

,
at

residence

seeing

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
some
slight
inclination

resume
the

he
said
,

At
the
end
of
a
moment

conversation
,
in
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
hinted
that
a
lady
of
elevated
rank
had
condescended
to
relieve
him
from
his

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
entered
.
``

``

cried

.
``

was

silent

as
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
the

inquisitive
of
any

on
earth

<PROPER_NOUN>
's
confidence
stopped
there

gone

the

cast
a
rapid
glance
around
him
in
order
to
be
sure
that
nobody
could
either
see
or
hear
him
,
and
opening
his
ragged
vest
,
badly
held
together
by
a
leather
<UNK>
,
he
began
to
<UNK>
the
upper
part
of
his

from
which
he
drew
a
letter
.
``

was
stupefied

who

curious

always

his

As
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
details
of
<UNK>
,
D'Artagnan
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
no
objection
to
abandoning
this
important

to
him
.
``

look
at

``

know

It
must

is
not

crossing
the

,
still
driving
the
<NUMBER>
sorry

The

which
fired
the
eyes

in

terrified

repaired
trembling
to
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

guessed
the

awaited
her
there

was
fascinated
by
the
lofty

took

And
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
turning
on

made
a

asked
the

Come

''
The
evening
so
impatiently
waited
for
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
by
D'Artagnan
at
last
arrived
.
Our
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
,
by
the
first
glance
of
his
eye
,
that
his
billet
had
been
delivered
,
and
that
this
billet
had
had
its
effect
.
D'Artagnan
looked
at
the
<NUMBER>
women
,
<NUMBER>
after
the
other
,
and
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
in
his
opinion
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
made
a
mistake
in
their
<UNK>
.
She
looked
at
the
clock
,
rose
,
reseated
herself
,
smiled
at
D'Artagnan
with
an
air
which
said
,
``
You
are
very
amiable
,
no
doubt
,
but
you
would
be
charming
if
you
would
only
depart
.
''
Then
he
went
out
.
The
young
man
went
to
her
and
took
her
hands
;
then
she
sobbed
aloud
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
himself
was
frightened
by
the
change
in
her
countenance
.
For
the
rest
this
vengeance
was
very
easy
;
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
doubtless
to
conceal
her
blushes
from
her
lover
,
had
ordered
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
extinguish
all
the
lights
in
the
apartment
,
and
even
in
the
little
chamber
itself
.
Hardly
was
he
concealed
when
the
little
bell
sounded
.
Finally
,
as
the
hour
for
her
interview
with
the
count
approached
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
everything
about
her
darkened
,
and
ordered
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
return
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
introduce
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
whenever
he
presented
himself
.
demanded
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Well
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
trembling
voice
,
``
why
do
you
not
enter
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
in
a
<UNK>
situation
which
he
had
not
foreseen
.
Oh
,
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
,
I
must
have
some
pledge
from
you
which
will
prove
that
you
think

me
;
and
that
you
may
not
forget
me
,
take
this

''
Keep
that
ring
for
love
of
me
.
He
even
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
<PROPER_NOUN>
who
he
was
,
and
with
what
a
<UNK>
purpose
he
had
come
;
but
she
added
,
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
angel
,
whom
that
monster
of
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
barely
failed
to
kill

''
``
Be
tranquil
,
''
murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
I
will
avenge
you
-
and
cruelly
!
''
This
woman
exercised
over
him
an
unaccountable
power
;
he
hated
and
adored
her
at
the
same
time
.
D'Artagnan
at
the
moment
of
quitting
<PROPER_NOUN>
felt
only
the
liveliest
regret
at
the
parting
;
and
as
they
addressed
each
other
in
a
<UNK>
passionate
adieu
,
another
interview
was
arranged
for
the
following
week
.
He
therefore
told
him
all
.
``
You
notice
my
ring
?
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
No
.
``
Her
very
self
;
she
gave
it
me
last
night
.
A
shade
of
anger
and
vengeance
passed
across
the
usually
calm
brow
of
this
gentleman
.
``
Do
you
know
this
ring
?
''
``
Pray
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
after
a
minute
,
``
either
take
off
that
ring
or
turn
the
mounting
inside
;
it
recalls
such
cruel
recollections
that
I
shall
have
no
head
to
converse
with
you
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
took
off
the
ring
,
giving
it
again
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
But
from
whom
did
this
ring
come
to
you
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
?
''
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
hesitatingly
.
He
took
back
the
ring
,
but
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
not
on
his
finger
.
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
I
will
have
done
with
her
.
``
I
shall
,
''
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
instantly
.
''
A
month
of
fever
could
not
have
changed
her
more
than
this
<NUMBER>
night
of
<UNK>
and
sorrow
.
The
counsels
of
his
friend
,
joined
to
the
cries
of
his
own
heart
,
made
him
determine
,
now
his
pride
was
saved
and
his
vengeance
satisfied
,
not
to
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
.
I
kiss
your
hands
.
That
which
would
now
be
considered
as
disgraceful
to
a
gentleman
was
at
that
time
quite
a
simple
and
natural
affair
,
and
the
younger
sons
of
the
best
families
were
frequently
supported
by
their
mistresses
.
The
heart
of
the
best
woman
is
pitiless
toward
the
sorrows
of
a
rival
.
``
Impossible
!
''
can
he
have
-
''
and
she
stopped
.
``
What
do
you
want
with
me

That

was

This

<PROPER_NOUN>

reminded

had
a
visit
to
pay

at

bade

observe

He
came
to
this
melancholy
conclusion
as
he
entered
the
antechamber

Only
,
as

was
not
easily
intimidated

see
what

resembled

he
placed

haughtily
in

the

and
waited
with
his

on

in
an
attitude
by
no

deficient
in
majesty

The
usher
introduced
him
,
and
retired
without
speaking
a

At
the
end

an

the

closed
his

upon

was
written
``

raised

awaiting
the

without

The

about

be
resumed

``
That

said
the
cardinal

with
a
tone

vexation

through
which

however

might
be
seen
a
sort
of
esteem
;
``

significantly

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

promise

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
out
,
but
at
the
door
his
heart
almost
failed
him
,
and
he
felt
inclined
to
return
.
With
a
word
,
D'Artagnan
reassured
them
;
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
ran
to
inform
the
other
sentinels
that
it
was
useless
to
keep
guard
longer
,
as
his
master
had
come
out
safe
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>

But
when
they
were
alone
he
said
,
``
You
have
done
that
which
you
ought
to
have
done
,
D'Artagnan
;
but
perhaps
you
have
been
wrong

''
At
that
time
it
was
believed
that
the
separation
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
would
be
but
momentary
,
the
king
holding
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
very
day
and
proposing
to
set
out
the
day
after
.
That
night
,
then
,
was
somewhat
<UNK>
,
as
may
be
imagined
.
In
fact
,
the
evening
before
,
a
fever
had
seized
him
in
the
midst
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
while
he
was
holding
his
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
She
loved
<PROPER_NOUN>
too
dearly
to
allow
him
to
part
thus
;
she
made
him
a
sign
to
dismount
and
come
to
her
.
Nevertheless
,
<NUMBER>
thing
afforded
him
inward
consolation
;
it
was
expected
by
everybody
that
the
campaign
would
be
a
severe
<NUMBER>
.
As
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
;
but
no
evil
impressions
were
taken
from
her
grief
as
she
was
known
to
be
very
much
attached
to
her
relatives
,
about
whom
she
was
constantly
having
serious
<UNK>
with
her
husband
.
On
his
part
<PROPER_NOUN>
wrote
a
long
letter
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
sipped
the
last
bottle
of
his
Spanish
wine
.
Then
,
certain
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
in
the
execution
of
her
orders
,
she
started
her
horse
and
disappeared
.
The
political
plans
of
the
cardinal
when
he
undertook
this
siege
were
extensive
.
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
and
Italian
<UNK>
,
adventurers
of
all
nations
,
and
soldiers
of
fortune
of
every
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
at
the
first
summons
under
the
standard
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
and
organized
themselves
like
a
vast
association
,
whose
branches
<UNK>
freely
over
all
parts
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
right
.
Was
this
love
a
simple
political
affair
,
or
was
it
naturally
<NUMBER>
of
those
profound
passions
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
inspired
in
those
who
approached
her
?
On
his
side
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
pretending
to
maintain
the
honor
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
was
moved
by
interests
exactly
like
those
of
the
cardinal
.
The
first
advantage
had
been
gained
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
This
event
had
hastened
the
resolutions
of
the
cardinal
;
and
till
the
king
and
he
could
take
the
command
of
the
siege
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
was
determined
,
he
had
sent
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
direct
the
first
operations
,
and
had
ordered
all
the
troops
he
could
dispose
of
to
march
toward
the
<UNK>
of
war
.
Now
,
whenever
the
king
halted
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
halted
.
Everything
was
in
the
same
state
.
From
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
had
been
mixed
up
with
public
affairs
;
but
his
own
private
affairs
had
made
no
great
progress
,
either
in
love
or
fortune
.
For
a
mind
so
<UNK>
as
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
this
indulgence
was
a
light
by
which
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
better
future
.
What
he
had
clearly
gained
in
all
this
was
the
diamond
,
worth
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
livres
,
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
;
and
even
this
diamond
-
supposing
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
his
projects
of
ambition
,
wished
to
keep
it
,
to
make
it
someday
a
pledge
for
the
gratitude
of
the
queen
-
had
not
in
the
meanwhile
,
since
he
could
not
part
with
it
,
more
value
than
the
gravel
he
trod
under
his
feet
.
He
comprehended
that
the
musket
had
not
come
there
of
itself
,
and
that
he
who
bore
it
had
not
concealed
himself
behind
a
hedge
with
any
friendly
intentions
.
At
the
same
instant
the
gun
was
fired
,
and
he
heard
the
whistling
of
a
ball
pass
over
his
head
.
Besides
,
courage
was
out
of
the
question
here
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
fallen
into
an
<UNK>
.
He
sat
down
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
,
and
began
to
reflect
.
The
accuracy
of
the
aim
had
first
given
him
the
idea
that
a
special
weapon
had
been
employed
.
But
<PROPER_NOUN>
again
shook
his
head
.
``
Ah
,
my
poor
friends
!
''
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
times
he
started
up
,
imagining
that
a
man
was
approaching
his
bed
for
the
purpose
of
<UNK>
him
.
At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
the
next
morning
,
the
drums
beat
to
arms
.
At
the
expiration
of
a
minute
or
<NUMBER>
,
it
appeared
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
him
a
sign
to
approach
.
replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
wished
for
nothing
better
than
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
under
the
eye
of
the
lieutenant
general
.
``
As
to
the
man
to
be
depended
upon
,
I
have
him
under
my
hand
,

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
pointing
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
and
as
to
the
<NUMBER>

<UNK>

<PROPER_NOUN>

make
his

known

and
the

will
not
be
wanting
.
''
D'Artagnan
declined
all
others
,
being
unwilling
to
take
the
first
chance
from
those
who
had
the
priority
.
There
,
on
turning
round
,
D'Artagnan
perceived
that
the
<NUMBER>
soldiers
had
disappeared
.
The
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
our
<UNK>
hope
were
<UNK>
whether
they
should
proceed
any
further
,
when
all
at
once
a
circle
of
smoke
enveloped
the
giant
of
stone
,
and
a
dozen
balls
came
whistling
around
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his
companions
.
On
arriving
at
the
angle
of
the
trench
which
was
to
serve
them
as

<PROPER_NOUN>

did

took
his

and
went
out

The

are
long
,
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
particular
,
would
have
<UNK>
that
the

were

.
This
anxiety
became
so
great
that
it
even
extended
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
what
does
it

after

?
Why

every

we

<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
is
a

of
little

which
the

counts
with

.
``
You
are
very
fastidious
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
such
a
beautiful
woman
!
''
The
day
,
however
,
passed
away
;
and
the
evening
came
on
slowly
,
but
finally
it
came
.
They
were
playing
together
,
as
usual
,
when
<NUMBER>
o'clock
sounded
;
the
patrol
was
heard
passing
to
double
the
posts
.
``
Come

''
said
he
,
``

''
``
I
have
the
note
,
''
said
he
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
to
his
friends
.
At
length
they
reached
the
tent
,
lit
a
lamp
,
and
while
<PROPER_NOUN>
stood
at
the
entrance
that
the
<NUMBER>
friends
might

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with

,
broke
the
seal
and
opened
the
so
anxiously
expected

.
Then
,
calling
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
said
,
``
Now

my

``

But
the
wind
was
contrary
,
the
sea
bad
;
they
tacked
and
kept
<UNK>
.
Add
these
<NUMBER>
to
the
<NUMBER>
others
,
that
would
be
<NUMBER>
days
lost
-
<NUMBER>
days
,
during
which
so
many
important
events
might
pass
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
All
the
city
was
agitated
by
an
extraordinary
movement
.
The
star
of
day
,
pale
but
nevertheless
still
splendid
,
was
setting
in
the
horizon
,
<UNK>
at
once
the
heavens
and
the
sea
with
bands
of
fire
,
and
casting
upon
the
towers
and
the
old
houses
of
the
city
a
last
ray
of
gold
which
made
the
windows
sparkle
like
the
reflection
of
a
conflagration
.
The
officer
alone
went
on
board
,
where
he
was
received
with
all
the
deference
inspired
by
the
uniform
.
He
then
returned
to
the
captain
,
said
a
few
words
to
him
,
and
as
if
from
that
moment
the
vessel
was
under
his
command
,
he
ordered
a
maneuver
which
the
crew
executed
immediately
.
But
however
great
was
the
power
of
this
woman
with
eyes
of
flame
in
reading
the
hearts
of
those
whose
secrets
she
wished
to
divine
,
she
met
this
time
with
a
countenance
of
such
<UNK>
that
no
discovery
followed
her
investigation
.
The
fog
increased
the
darkness
,
and
formed
round
the
<UNK>
and
lanterns
of
the
jetty
a
circle
like
that
which
surrounds
the
moon
when
the
weather
threatens
to
become
<UNK>
.
When
this
operation
was
complete
,
he
invited
her
to
descend
by
offering
her
his
hand
.
``
But
is
it
the
custom
for
the
officers
in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
navy
to
place
themselves
at

female
compatriots
when
they
land
in
a
port
of
Great
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
carry
their
gallantry
so
far
as
to
conduct
them
ashore
?
''
``
But
I
am
not
a
foreigner
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
with
an
accent
as
pure
as
ever
was
heard
between
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
my
name
is
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

and
this

-
''
``
This

madame
;
and
you
will
seek
in
vain
to
evade
it
.
''
A
large
cloak
was
spread
at
the
stern
;
the
officer
requested
her
to
sit
down
upon
this
cloak
,
and
placed
himself
beside
her
.
In
<NUMBER>
minutes
they
gained
the
land
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Very
well
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
she
resolutely
entered
the
carriage
.
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
however
,
surprised
at
the
length
of
the
journey
,
she
leaned
forward
toward
the
door
to
see
whither
she
was
being
conducted
.
The
young
officer
preserved
silence
.
``
Help
!
The
young
man
remained
immovable
.
The
officer
leaned
forward
,
looked
at
her
in
his
turn
,
and
appeared
surprised
to
see
that
face
,
just
before
so
beautiful
,
distorted
with
passion
and
almost
hideous
.
``
It
is
the
first
time
I
have
had
the
honor
of
seeing
you
.
''
At
length
after
a
journey
of
nearly
an
hour
,
the
carriage
stopped
before
an
iron
gate
,
which
closed
an
avenue
leading
to
a
castle
severe
in
form
,
massive
,
and
isolated
.
``
Still
,
then
,
I
am
a
prisoner
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
looking
around
her
,
and
bringing
back
her
eyes
with
a
most
gracious
smile
to
the
young
officer
;
``
but
I
feel
assured
it
will
not
be
for
long
,
''
added
she
.
Then
the
officer
,
with
the
same
calm
politeness
,
invited
his
prisoner
to
enter
the
house
.
It
was
a
chamber
whose
furniture
was
at
once
appropriate
for
a
prisoner
or
a
free
man
;
and
yet
bars
at
the
windows
and
outside
bolts
at
the
door
decided
the
question
in
favor
of
the
prison
.
It
might
have
been
said
that
between
this
man
and
his
<UNK>
spoken
language
did
not
exist
,
or
had
become
useless
.
Where
am
I
,
and
why
am
I
here
?
I
received
orders
to
go
and
take
charge
of
you
on
the
sea
,
and
to
conduct
you
to
this
castle
.
asked
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
warmly
.
``
That
person
is
here
,
madame
,
''
said
the
officer
,
leaving
the
entrance
open
,
and
drawing
himself
up
in
an
attitude
of
respect
.
The
stranger
advanced
slowly
,
and
as
he
advanced
,
after
entering
into
the
circle
of
light
projected
by
the
lamp
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
involuntarily
drew
back
.
``
But
this
castle
,
then
?
''
``
I
am
,
then
,
your
prisoner
?
''
Let
us
sit
down
and
chat
quietly
,
as
brother
and
sister
ought
to
do
.
''
She
knew
her
brother-in-law
to
be
a
worthy
gentleman
,
a
bold
<UNK>
,
an
intrepid
player
,
enterprising
with
women
,
but
by
no
means
remarkable
for
his
skill
in
intrigues
.
She
rather
feared
that
her
preceding
operations
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
might
have
been
discovered
.
At
all
events
,
she
congratulated
herself
upon
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
her
brother-in-law
,
with
whom
she
reckoned
she
could
deal
very
easily
,
rather
than
into
the
hands
of
an
acknowledged
and
intelligent
enemy
.
``
To
begin
with
,
tell
me
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
have
you
watched
me
so
closely
as
to
be
aware
beforehand
not
only
of
my
arrival

but
even

the

the

,
and
the

at
which
I
should
arrive
?
''
``
Ah
,
to

me

''
``
And
you
had
no

''
``
The

``
And
my
only
heir

are
you
not
?
''
The
first
idea
that
occurred
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
mind
was
that
she
had
been
betrayed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
that
she
had
recounted
to
the
baron
the
selfish
aversion
toward
himself
of
which
she
had
imprudently
allowed
some
marks
to
escape
before
her
servant

Is
there
any
secret
meaning
concealed
beneath
your
words
?
''
I
learn
this
desire
,
or
rather
I
suspect
that
you
feel
it
;
and
in
order
to
spare
you
all
the
<UNK>
of
a
nocturnal
arrival
in
a
port
and
all
the
fatigues
of
landing
,
I
send
<NUMBER>

my

to
meet
you

I
place
a

at

and
he
brings
you
hither
to
this
castle

of
which
I
am
governor
,
whither
I
come
every
day
,
and
where
,
in
order
to
satisfy
our
mutual
desire
of
seeing
each
other
,
I
have
prepared
you
a
chamber

Have
you
not
observed
that
the
captain

your

on
entering
the

sent
forward

obtain

a

bearing
his

the

My
heart
told
me
what
your

has
just
confirmed
-
that
is
to
say
,
with
what
view
you
have
exposed
yourself
to
the

so
perilous

<PROPER_NOUN>
received
this
look
like
a

it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a

Although

the

this

The

The

the

Then
the

whatever

very

knew
that
the
horror
of
<UNK>
in

He

came

his

going
at

to

surrounded
by

The
cardinal
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
in
very
low
spirits
;
and
nothing
when
he
was
in
that
state
of
mind
increased
his
depression
so
much
as
gaiety
in
others
.
It
may
be
supposed
that
his
desire
to
hear
the
conversation
was
augmented
by
this
discovery
.
``
You
are
speaking
,
you
scoundrel

The
cardinal
seemed
furious
.
``

continued
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

it

avail

I
do
not

they
have
the
advantage
of
serving
in

thus
to
play
the
great
lords

discipline
is
the
same
for
them
as
for
everybody
else

If
we
are
so
fortunate
as
to
have
some
particular
duty
to
perform
for
your
Eminence
,
we
are
ready
to
obey
you

The
cardinal
bit
his
mustache
,
and
even
his
lips
a
little
.
``
Oh
,
as
to
that
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
it
is
true
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``
we
do
conspire

as
your

have
seen
the

The
color
mounted
to
the
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,

he
made
a
step
toward
his
Eminence

replied
the
cardinal
.
``
A

He
turned
round
as

to
give
an
order
to
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Well

If
there
were
any

on

I
am
going

I
would
request
you
to
accompany
me

but
as
there
is
none
,
remain
where
you

finish

Then
they
looked
at
<NUMBER>

cried
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
a
great
inclination
to
vent
his
ill-humor

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Indeed

this

is
very
much

That

never

``
In

let
there
be

resume

interrupted

``

That

his

continued
his
melancholy
ride

murmuring
between

,
``
These

positively

<PROPER_NOUN>
has
conquered

<PROPER_NOUN>
had
passed

From

can
come
so
many

What
hatred
she
<UNK>
!
And
to
be

a

has
to
pierce

detach
bars

cut

all
undertakings

a
patient

strong
man
may
accomplish
,
but
before
which
the

But
by

she
overcame
the

of
her
mad
passion

nervous
<UNK>
which
agitated
her

disappeared

she
remained

In

I
have
never

Then
her

assumed
successively
,
under

skillful
hands
,
all
the
undulations
she
thought
might
assist
the
charms
of
her

A
better
idea
,
however
,
came
into
her
mind
before
going
to
bed
.
A
light
appeared
under
the
door
;
this

announced
the
<UNK>
of

jailers
.
``

She
perceived
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
sat
with
his

toward
her
.
As
a
result
she
raised
her
head
,
opened
her

,
and
sighed
deeply
.
``
Oh

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a

bow
,

directed
his

toward

said
he
,
in
a
jeering
voice
,
on
seeing
the

sitting
up
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
about
to

out

Milady
shuddered
through
her

``

between

;
``

Her
hands
clutched
her
armchair
;
she
ground
her
teeth
inwardly
;
her
eyes
followed
the
motion
of
the
door
as
it
closed
behind
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
moment
she
was
alone
a
fresh
fit
of
despair
seized
her
.
``
Ha

Observe
,
this
is
<NUMBER>
of

to
get
rid
thus

<UNK>
her

In

<PROPER_NOUN>
still
held
the

weapon
in

but
these

words

this
supreme
insult
,
relaxed
her
hands
,
her
strength
,
and
even
her
will
.
But
this
time
Milady
lent
a
more
attentive
ear
than
the
first
,
and
she
heard
their
steps
die
away
in
the
distance
of
the
corridor
.
In
fact
,
as
this
last
reflection
indicated
-
this
instinctive
return
to
hope
-
sentiments
of
weakness
or
fear
did
not
dwell
long
in

spirit

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
that

<PROPER_NOUN>
dreamed
that

had

in

it

which
spread

He

this

offered

Are

likely

be

<UNK>
to
me
than

were
yesterday
?
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
to
this
dialogue
without
speaking
a

said
she
.
``
Eh
,
how
can
I
tell

``
Go
and
fetch
<PROPER_NOUN>
de

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
tired
of
these

She
gave
so
much
vehemence
,
such
<UNK>
eloquence
to
this
exclamation
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
spite
of
himself
advanced
some
steps
into
the
room
.
But
at

we
shall
not
have

reproach
ourselves
with
anything

''
``
I
fancy
I
begin
to
see
my

murmured
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
a
savage
joy
,
burying
herself
under
the
clothes
to
conceal
from
anybody
who
might
be
watching

this

of
inward
satisfaction

In
the

when
they
entered

they
had
brought
her
breakfast

<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
behind

held

By

polished
like

not

into

had
guessed
aright

<NUMBER>
hours
passed
away
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
knew
she
might
be
watched
,
so
she
continued
her
prayers
to
the
end
;
and
it
appeared
to
her
that
the
soldier
who
was
on
duty
at
her
door
did
not
march
with
the

step
,
and
seemed
to
listen
.
He
feared
,
then
,
to
see
her
too
often
.
While
singing
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
listened
.
It
appeared
to
her
that
the
sounds
spread
to
a
distance
beneath
the
vaulted
roofs
,
and
carried
with
them
a
magic
charm
to
soften
the
hearts
of
her
jailers
.
then
exclaimed
another
stern
voice
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
recognized
as
that
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
You
were
told
to
guard
her
-
to
fire
at
her
if
she
attempted
to
fly
.
Without
appearing
to
have
heard
the
dialogue
,
of
which
she
had
not
lost
a
word
,
she
began
again
,
giving
to
her
voice
all
the
charm
,
all
the
power
,
all
the
seduction
the
demon
had
bestowed
upon
it
:
<UNK>
``
For

,
who
counts

''
This
verse
,
into
which
the
terrible
<UNK>
threw
her
whole
soul
,
completed
the
trouble
which
had
seized
the
heart
of
the
young
officer
.
``
Your
pardon

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
with
mildness

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
beautiful
at
this
moment
,
the
religious
ecstasy
in
which
she
appeared
to
be
plunged
gave
such
an
expression
to
her

,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
so
dazzled
that
he
fancied

beheld

``
No

<PROPER_NOUN>
might
fail

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
forewarned

and
that
against
the

chance

She
had
laid
that
down
the
preceding
evening
.
At
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
retire
,
she
was
cheered
with
a
ray
of
hope
,
for
she
thought
he
was
about
to
speak
;
but
his
lips
moved
without
any
sound
leaving
his

,
and
making
a
powerful
effort
to
control
himself

he
sent
back
to
his

the

escape
from

and
went
out
.
``
Ah

You

Milady
folded

raising

fine

toward

,
``

with
an

``

At
the
moment
he
went
out
a
piercing
glance
darted
through
the
opening
of
the
nearly
closed
door
,
and
she
perceived

drew
quickly
to

The

opened
gently

in

broken
by

The

took
the

by

over

with

But
this

had
to
contend
with
an

concentrated
and

In

she

taken
the

through

the

recognize

in

-
once
this
order
was
signed
,
we
say
,
the

would
make

embark
immediately
,
and
she
knew
very
well
that
women
condemned

employ

much

than
the

and
whom
a

like
that

days
not

inauspicious

Then
that
which
spurred
her
on
<UNK>
in
the

all
this
was
the
remembrance

Then
Milady
collected
all

murmuring
in

the

the

penetrated
to
her

evening

doubtless
neither

sank
upon

Several
strokes
resounded
on
the
door
;
this

Milady
really
pushed
him
away
from

We
are
lost

He
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
sergeant
commanding
a
watch
-
patrol
.
I
heard
you
cry
out
,
without
understanding
what
you
said

Milady
plainly
perceived
that
it
was
now
her
turn
to
take
part
in
the
scene
.
At
that
moment
a
burst
of
ironical
laughter
resounded
through
the
corridor
.
Milady
perceived
that
all
was
lost
unless
she
gave
<PROPER_NOUN>
an
immediate
and
terrible
proof
of
her
courage
.
But
the

had
fortunately
,
we
ought

,
come
in
contact
with
the
steel
<UNK>
,
which
at
that
period
,
like
a

,
defended
the
<UNK>

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
snatched
away
the
knife
.
Be
tranquil
,
and
go
wait
for
me
in
my
chamber
.
''
Meanwhile
,
all
things
considered
and
notwithstanding
his
suspicions
,
as
the
wound
might
be
serious
,
he
immediately
sent
off
a
mounted
man
to
find
a
physician
.
Thus
the
poor
woman
was
completely
the
dupe
of
the
prisoner
,
whom
,
notwithstanding
her
<UNK>
,
she
persisted
in
watching
all
night
.
Milady
smiled
at
this
thought
,
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
now
her
only
hope
-
her
only
means
of
safety
.
In
the
morning
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
under
the
pretext
that
she
had
not
slept
well
in
the
night
and
wanted
rest
,
sent
away
the
woman
who
attended
her
.
She
had
only
<NUMBER>
day
left
.
Milady
then
perceived
,
with
terror
,
that
the
uniform
of
the
soldiers
who
guarded
her
was
changed
.
The
soldier
replied
that
he
was
,
and
that
he
had
given
orders
to
be
informed
if
the
prisoner
wished
to
speak
to
him

The
<UNK>
were
removed
.
The
bed
,
which
she
had
kept
from
prudence
and
that
they
might
believe
her
seriously
wounded
,
burned
her
like
a
bed
of
fire
.
She
was
free
now
to
give
way
to
her
transports
without
being
observed
.
He
was
armed
at
all
points
.
``
Ay

''
He
was
yielding
to
your
infernal
influence
;
but
I
will
save
him
.
I
had
fixed
the
embarkation
for
the
<UNK>
;
but
I
have
reflected
that
the
more
promptly
the
affair
takes
place
the
more
sure
it
will
be
.
If
when
on
the
ship
you
speak
a
single
word
to
anyone
before
the
captain
permits
you
,
the
captain
will
have
you
thrown
into
the
sea

With
these
words
the
baron
went
out
.
She
did
not
know
what
might
take
place
during
this
night
which
approached
so
<UNK>
-
for
large
masses
of
cloud
rolled
over
the
face
of
the
sky
,
and
distant
lightning
announced
a
storm
.
It
appeared
to
her
that
the
blast
as
it
swept
along
disheveled
her
brow
,
as
it
bowed
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
bore
away
their
leaves
.
``

I
must
have
time
to

through

``

Go

or
at

lie
down
in

``

Amid
the
moaning
of
the
storm
she
heard
the
<UNK>
of
the
file
upon

bars

and
by
the
light
of
every
flash
she
perceived
the
shadow

through

<PROPER_NOUN>
sprang
out

opened

``

said
he
,
``

For

an
emotion
of
terror
reminded
her
that
she
was

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

ask

``

``

descend

Both
remained
suspended

motionless
and
breathless
,
within
<NUMBER>
paces
of
the
ground
,
while
the
patrol
passed
beneath
them
laughing
and
talking
.
``
Now

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

are
safe

''
He
stooped
down
,
picked
up
the
bag
of
money
,
and
placed
it
between
his
teeth
.
The
boat
approached
as
near
as
it
could
to
the
shore
;
but
there
was
not
depth
enough
of
water
for
it
to
touch
land
.
``

sloop

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
and
row

It
was
almost
impossible

see
the
shore
from
the
boat
;
they
would
therefore
be
less
likely
to
see
the
boat
from
the
shore
.
When
her
hands
were
<UNK>
he
took
some
sea
water
and
sprinkled
it
over
her
face
.
``
Saved

``

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
looking
at
those
beautiful
hands
,
and
shaking
his
head
sorrowfully
.
Milady
looked
around
her
,
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
``
What
vessel
is
that

''
``
Where

During

was
thus
with
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
from

She
inquired
for
the
convent

and
went
thither
immediately

The

the

the

talking

She
did
not

whether
the
abbess
was
a

she

confined
herself
to
a

The

listened
more

grew

and
smiled
.
The

only
crossed

And

remembered
that

succeeded

her
enterprise

All
these
hopes
were
so
many

;
so

rocked
by
them

she
soon
fell

Each
examined

while
exchanging

When

she
left

presented
themselves
,
and

clear

positive

serious

from

Then
,
lackeys
who
ask

inspire

with

These

the

retired

<PROPER_NOUN>
nevertheless

visibly
anxious

then
plunged
into

the
man

indicated
with
his
finger
;
but
arriving
at
<NUMBER>
crossroads
,
he
stopped
again
,
visibly
embarrassed
.
The
night
watch
evinced
the

terror
,
refused
,
in
his
turn
,
to
accompany
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
only
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
road
he
was
to
take
.
The
mendicant
hesitated
at
first
,
but
at
the
sight
of
the
piece
of
silver
which
shone
in
the
darkness
he
consented
,
and
walked
on
before
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
No
light
appeared
through
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
;
no
noise
gave
reason
to
believe

it
was
inhabited

The
door
at
length
was
opened
,
and
a
man
appeared
,
of
high
stature
,
pale
complexion
,
and
black
hair

.
All
the
frame
was
adjusted
except
the

lay
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
cast
a

upon

,
and
at

sat
down
near

The
tall
man
had
scarcely
read
these

,
seen
the
signature

and
recognized
the
seal
,
when
he
bowed
to

that

had

make

replied

At

appointed
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
and

repaired

the

to

there
upon

following

left

he
advanced
toward

gate
which
led
into

wood
,
and
causing
it
to
be
opened

he
went
out
into

Between

a

was
the

he

noted
the

went

<PROPER_NOUN>
went
and
presented
himself
as

out
of

who
was
in

All
their

melancholy

even
the

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>

Each
examined
his

put

in

The

looked
round

with

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
the

Musketeers
looked
at

inquiringly

It
was
a
stormy

dark
night
;
vast
clouds
covered
the
heavens
,
concealing
the
stars
;
the
moon
would
not
rise
till

They
passed
in
silence
through
the
little
village
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
the
wounded
servant
was
,
and
then
skirted
the
wood
of

The

,
the

succeeded
<NUMBER>
another
more
rapidly
,
the
thunder
began
to
growl
,
and
the
wind
,
the

of

whistled
in
the

of

By

perceived

``
Silence

<PROPER_NOUN>
extended
his

and
by

they
distinguished
a

At

<PROPER_NOUN>

perceiving

pushed

A

performed

She

attempt

went
out

In

the

rolled
its

did

On

the

Then
he
placed
her

as
he
was
going

set
foot
in

himself

<PROPER_NOUN>
handed

a

The

moved
off

The

A

The

sank
into
a

reverie

he
did
not
return

The

The

from

the

In

the

informed
was
that
he
was
fed
and
lodged
in
some
royal
castle
,
at
the
expense
of
his
generous

.
On
seeing
this

the
inquisitive

manifested
with
rustic
freedom
their
contempt
for
such
paltry
sport
,
and
,
after
a
dissertation
among
themselves
upon
the

they
returned
to

<NUMBER>
only
of

In

continued
his

so
majestic

that

certainly
would

attracted
the

if

but
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
could
not
pardon
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
having
chosen
their
gay
city
for
an
abode
in
which
to
indulge

at

and
as
often
as
they
caught
a

they
stole

gaping

that

But
it

A

be
cut

without
feeling

and
as

since

no

been

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
occupation

gone
,
and
his

suffered
from

<PROPER_NOUN>
rode
a

horse

equipped

saddle
of
red
Flemish
velvet

with
stirrups
in

shape
of

the
horse
was
of

pourpoint
of
crimson
velvet
corresponded
with

equipment
,
and
it
was
only
by
this
red
appearance

that

could
be
known
from

<NUMBER>
companions

the

At

guards

in

sun
in
the
square
court

ran
to

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
his
solemn
entry
into

All
at

,
in

silence
,
there
resounded
a

ringing
laugh
,
which
caused

in
the
enjoyment
of

<UNK>
to
open
at

The
position

between

At

laughter
that
proceeded
from

she
raised

her

were
wanting

You

did
ring

He
had
all

been

hear

rather
to
undergo
this
cry
of
``

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
this
movement
,
and
called
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
worthy
man
immediately
hastened
after
<PROPER_NOUN>

Raoul
thus
once
more
got
rid
of
the
old

,
and
pursued
his
way
.
The
young

turned
round
,
surprised
,
and
saw
a
dark

girl
,
who
,
with
a
finger
on

held
out
her

said
he
.
``

The

replied
by
springing
up

after

``
One

The

continued
to

he
followed

did
the

``
Yes

''
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
in
contact
with
that
trembling
hand
,
took
it
within
his
own
,
and
carried
it
so
respectfully
to
his
lips
,
that
he
might
be
said
to
have
deposited
a

upon
it
rather
than

<PROPER_NOUN>
blushed
at
seeing
the

of
the

he
did
not

This

made
<PROPER_NOUN>
laugh

Raoul
sigh
with
happiness
,
for
he
interpreted
it
thus
:
``
She

all
our

exclaimed
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
,
clapping
her

Oh

The

will
dispense
with
a
second
description
of
that
habitation
:
he
,
perhaps
,
has
been
with
us
there
before
,
and
knows
it
.
It
was
more
than
a
year
since
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
been
to
visit
his
father
.
The
<PROPER_NOUN>
de

<PROPER_NOUN>

still
faithful

loyalty

,
<NUMBER>
day
developed
before

-
the

in

<PROPER_NOUN>

therefore

had

in

served
obstinately
and
<UNK>
the
fortunes

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
spite
of
the
<UNK>
which
were
<UNK>
,
and
,
it
might
be
said
,
inevitable
,
at
that
period
.
We
have
seen
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
left
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
another
love
in
addition
to
filial
love
.
The
old
man
,
who
was
<UNK>
with
his
hands
a
bed
of
<UNK>
roses
and
<UNK>
,
was
indignant
at
seeing
a
horse
thus
traversing
his
<UNK>
and
<UNK>
walks
.
When
arrived
at
the
stables
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
his
horse
to
a
little
lackey
,
and
sprang
up
the
perron
with
an
ardor
that
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
his
father
.
A
brow
white
and
void
of
wrinkles
,
beneath
his
long
hair
,
now
more
white
than
black
;
an
eye
piercing
and
mild
,
under
the
lids
of
a

;
his
mustache
,
fine
but
slightly
<UNK>
,
waved
over
lips
of

,
as
if

had
never
been

by

passions
;
a

straight
and
<UNK>
;
an
irreproachable

thin
hand

this
was
what
remained
of
the
illustrious

whom
so
many

had
praised
under

Embrace

The
good
old
man
did
not
require
to
be
twice
told
;
he
rushed
in
with
open
arms
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
meeting
him
<UNK>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
looked
at
Raoul
with
a
melancholy
air
as
the
young
man
passed
out
;
observing
that
his
head
nearly
touched
the
traverse
of
the
doorway
,
stroking
his
white
<UNK>
,
he
slowly
murmured
:
``
How
he
has
grown
!
''
Where
were
to
be
lodged
all
the
<UNK>
of
the
neighborhood
,
who
would
gather
in
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
hours
after
the
news
had
enlarged
the
circle
of
its
report
,
like
the
increasing
<UNK>
produced
by
a
stone
thrown
into
a
placid
lake
?
The
whole
city
,
not
to
be
behind
in
this
luxury
of
<UNK>
,
assumed
its
best
toilette
with
the
help
of
<UNK>
,
<UNK>
,
and
water
.
They
knew
very
well
that
the
king
would
not
arrive
before
night
,
perhaps
not
before
the
next
morning
.
The
street
was
<UNK>
by
a
quarter
by
it
,
but
then
the
house
was
enlarged
by
a
half
;
and
was
not
that
a
sufficient
compensation
?
Towards
the
middle
of
the
reign
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
It
was
precisely
on
the
day
she
had
escaped
by
the
famous
window
.
When
he
found
himself
about
to
die
,
which
happened
in
<NUMBER>
,
just
after
the
death
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
called
to
him
his
son
,
a
young
cook
of
great
promise
,
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
he
recommended
him
to
preserve
carefully
the
secret
of
the
macaroni
,
to
<UNK>
his
name
,
and
at
length
,
when
the
political
horizon
should
be
cleared
from
the
clouds
which
obscured
it
-
this
was
practiced
then
as
in
our
day
,
to
order
of
the
nearest
<UNK>
a
handsome
sign
,
upon
which
a
famous
painter
,
whom
he
named

should
design
<NUMBER>
queens
'
portraits
,
with
these
words
as
a
legend
:
``
To

''
He
then
married
,
having
had
in
his
eye
a
little
French
girl
,
from
whose
parents
he
extorted
a
reasonable
dowry
by
showing
them
what
there
was
beneath
the
slab
of
the
chimney
.
His
works
,
of
which
he
had
never
sold
<NUMBER>
,
attracted
the
eye
at
a
distance
of
a
<NUMBER>
paces
;
but
they
so
<UNK>
displeased
the
citizens
,
that
he
had
finished
by
painting
no
more
.
Be
this
as
it
may
,
he
held
in
such
esteem
,
we
may
say
in
such
friendship
,
the
famous
Pittrino
,
that
he
took
him
in
his
own
house
.
His
joy
was
at
its
height
on
that
day
when
called
upon
to
share
the
secret
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
younger
,
and
to
paint
the
famous
sign
.
These
illustrious
ladies
appeared
so
lovely
on
the
sign
,
-
they
presented
to
the
astonished
eyes
such
an
assemblage
of
<UNK>
and
roses
,
the
enchanting
result
of
the
change
of
style
in
Pittrino
-
they
assumed
the
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
so
<UNK>
-
that
the
principal
<UNK>
,
when
admitted
to
view
this
capital
piece
in
the
salle
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
once
declared
that
these
ladies
were
too
handsome
,
of
too
animated
a
beauty
,
to
figure
as
a
sign
in
the
eyes
of
passers-by
.
What
answer
could
be
made
to
this
?
``
We
must
efface
the
legend
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
``
He
thought
most
of
the
legend
,
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
But
the
figures
?
''
``
Let
us
efface

<PROPER_NOUN>

'
''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
.
``
Yes
,
in
the
<UNK>
.
''
And
the
composition
?
''
He
composed
the
sign
of
<NUMBER>
physicians
,
with
the
legend
;
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
and
authorized
it
.
And
this
is
how
there
was
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
hostelry
of
that
name
,
and
had
for
<UNK>
Master
Pittrino
.
Himself
,
his
wife
,
Pittrino
,
and
<NUMBER>
cooks
,
immediately
laid
hands
upon
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
<UNK>
,
the
<UNK>
,
and
the
<UNK>
;
so
that
as
many
lamentations
and
cries
resounded
in
the
yards
of
the
hostelry
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
as
were
formerly
heard
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
spoke
to
people
looking
them
full
in
the
face
without
affectation
,
it
is
true
,
but
without
scruple
;
so
that
the
brilliancy
of
his
black
eyes
became
so
insupportable
,
that
more
than
<NUMBER>
look
had
sunk
beneath
his
like
the
weaker
sword
in
a
single
combat
.
He
had
taken
,
without
hesitation
,
without
reflection
even
,
the
principal
apartment
which
the
hotelier
had
pointed
out
to
him
with
a
<UNK>
aim
,
very
<UNK>
,
some
will
say
,
very
<UNK>
will
say
others
,
if
they
admit
that
Cropole
was
a
physiognomist
and
judged
people
at
first
sight
.
He
afterwards
preserved
so
profound
a
silence
,
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
almost
offended
,
so
much
did
he
prefer
people
who
were
good
company
.
Soon
the
cries
of
the
victims
<UNK>
in
the
<UNK>
,
the
hasty
steps
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
up
that
little
wooden
staircase
,
so
narrow
and
so
<UNK>
,
the
bounding
pace
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
only
that
morning
was
smoking
at
the
door
with
all
the
phlegm
of
a
<UNK>
;
all
this
communicated
something
like
surprise
and
agitation
to
the
traveler
.
She
only
gave
<NUMBER>
furtive
glance
at
the
handsome
gentleman
,
and
disappeared
.
``
I

drew
from

with
heroic

a

with

He
raised
his

with
a

despairing

brushed
off
with
his

some

trickled
over
his

then
cast
down

Then

Cropole
turned
around

on

cleared
a

The

leaned

the

clasping

After
this

ensued
a

broken
only
by

beating

the

All

of

<PROPER_NOUN>
,

it

seldom

always
poorly

as
they

a

and
monsieur

a

many
found

so

as
to
say
,
-
``
Why

the

is
not
so
tall
as

But
as
he
saw
nothing
upon
the
impassible
visage
of
the
cardinal
,
nothing
on
that
of
his

,
nothing
on
those

he
resigned

and
sat
down

taking
care

be
seated
before
anybody

A

pronounced

<PROPER_NOUN>

like

was
inquiring

regretted

he

not

laughing

in

,
``

ceremoniously

The

smiled

were
just

And
<PROPER_NOUN>
herself

of
ingenious
ideas

would
not

attempted

recall

for
ridicule

beauty
even

These
words
were
pronounced
with
that
tact
-
that
measure
,
that
<UNK>
of
tone
,
of
intention
,
and
reach
-
which
made
<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
first
<UNK>
in

He
could
not
remain
quiet
in
a
place

but
cast
around
an
uncertain

dead

and
<UNK>
look
over
the
assembly
.
At
this
door
,
in
the
embrasure
of
which
he
was
leaning
,
he
saw
,
standing
out
strongly
,
a
figure
with
a
brown
and
lofty
countenance
,
an
aquiline
nose
,
a
stern
but
brilliant
eye

gray
and
long
hair

a

the
true
type

military
beauty
,
whose
<UNK>
,
more
sparkling
than
a
mirror
,
broke
all
the
reflected
lights
which
concentrated
upon
it
,
and
sent
them
back
as
lightning
.
Above
all
,
he
appeared
,
like
a
philosopher
,
and
all
old
soldiers
are
philosophers

-
he
appeared
above
all
to
comprehend
the

better

in

took
his

knowing
very

in
a
clear

sonorous
voice

said
the
queen
,
whilst
<PROPER_NOUN>
satisfied
himself
with
interrogating
by
a
look
which
might
have
appeared
mild
if
it
had
not
been
so
piercing

The
king
bowed
,
crossed
the
hall
,
and
gained
the
door
,
where
a
hedge
of
<NUMBER>
musketeers
awaited
him

The

surrounded

stopped

he
with
a
shudder

It
was
here
that
he
was
struck

''
And
he
endeavored
to
resume
the
march
,
as
if
ill
at
ease
at
being
between
walls
formerly
defiled
by
treachery
.
There
was
a
bed
there
,
the
curtains
of
which
he
tore
with
catching
at
them
.
''
And
even
then
,

added
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
pointing
the
flambeau
to
the
spot

``
even
then
this

``
Let

go

said
he

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
to
his
nephew

embraced
him
,
and
then
went
out
.
He
refreshed
his
lamp
,
drank
half
a
glass
of
wine
,
curled
his
lip
with
a
smile
full
of
expression
,
installed
himself
in

armchair
,
and
made
preparations
for
sleeping
.
That
which
would
still
further
have
appeared
,
if
not
inconvenient
,
at

extraordinary
,
to
a
stranger
,
was
,
that
the
side
of
the
castle
destined
for
monsieur

cardinal
was
brilliant
,
light
and
cheerful
.
When
once
the
doors
were
closed
,
there
was
no

an
appearance
of
royalty
.
<NUMBER>
minutes
after
his
<UNK>
in

Behind

<UNK>
nobles

pages

the

gleamed
over
the

like
the
moving

What

according

induced
him
to
direct

that

the

``

replied
the

haughtily

tranquilly

On

the

And
this

the

accompanied
his

but
the

stirred
no

dashing
his

across
it

made

opened

As

he
had
acquired

the

<PROPER_NOUN>

It
appeared
to
him
that
he
could
almost
recognize
the

upon

that

his

Thus
everything

was

enjoyment

From

he
followed

The

<PROPER_NOUN>

<NUMBER>
of

,
half
drunk
with

came

in

his

Monk
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
had
at
first
thought
of
<UNK>
an
army
each
for
himself
:
Monk
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
were
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
and
the
royalists
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
<UNK>
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
where
was
found

as

always
the

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in

<PROPER_NOUN>

an

king
of

had
more

led
on

victory
;
as
well

nay

even
better

of

affairs
of
<PROPER_NOUN>

who
held

-
such
was
the
position
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
when
,
at
a
<NUMBER>
leagues
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
he
declared
himself
for
the
parliament
.
He
judged
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
,
and
that
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not
so
far
distant
from
the
<UNK>
that
an

could
not
march
from
<NUMBER>

particularly
when
it
was
well

.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
always
circumspect
,
stopped
where
he
was

and
placed
his

quarters
at

on

If
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
commanded
an
English
army
,
that
was
enough
to
have
brought
about

.
Monk
ordered
search
to
be
made
;
his
<UNK>
had
on
arriving
in
the
place
found
it
deserted
and
the
cupboards
empty
;
upon

and
<UNK>
it
was
of
no

in
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
for
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
very
absolute
,
under
the
appearance
of
the
most
perfect
mildness
.
Between
his
camp
and
that
of
the
enemy
stood
an
old
abbey
,
of
which
,
at
the
present
day
,
there
only
remain
some
ruins
,
but
which
then
was
in
existence
,
and
was
called
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
Unfortunately
it
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
early
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
the
kitchen-garden
,
being
abandoned
,
offered
no
resources
.
Monk
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
this
position
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
its
environs
having
already
more
than
once
been
his
headquarters
.
All
at
once
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
roused
from
his
half
sleep
,
fictitious
perhaps
,
by
a
troop
of
soldiers
,
who
came
with
joyous
cries
,
and
<UNK>
the
poles
of
his
tent
with
a
humming
noise
as
if
on
purpose
to
wake
him
.
``

But

``

continued
he
,
``

The

was
awakened
in

reached
him
.

It
then
became
necessary

not

''
``
Yes

my

in
a
straight

cried
the
fisherman
,
with
loud

expansive
frankness

``

a
lucky

not
put

can
make

Monk
followed
with
the
greatest
attention
the
rapid

heightened

and
<UNK>
conversation
of
the
fisherman
,
in
a
language
which
was
not
his

but
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
he
spoke
with
great
facility
.
``

said
the

with
a

not

he

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

the

after

he
left

accompanied
by

As
to
the
gentleman
,
ignorant
that
he
was
<UNK>
compatriots
,
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
little
troop
.
The
sight
of
this
appeared
to
delight
the
leader
of
the
fishermen
infinitely
.
Without
doubt
,
the
report
of
those
who
had
accompanied
the
French
gentleman
established
the
discretion
with
which
he
had
behaved
,
for
the
first
impression
the
stranger
received
of
the
welcome
made
him
by

more
favorable

he
could
have

on
the

suspicious
a

``
I
have
requested

These

were
spoken
in
French

and
with
a
purity
of
accent

raised

moved

<NUMBER>

every

in

he
did
not
return
,
a

felucca
,
manned
by
eleven

,
cast
anchor
upon
the
coast
of

nearly
within

It
was
on

no

that
a

was
detached
from
the

as

had

came

Immediately

,
according

have
produced
their

then
he
ventured

asked

at

weak

``

He
then
,
with

care

closed
the
door

this

after

he
opened

An

Monk
watched

It

D'Artagnan

<PROPER_NOUN>

The

Suddenly

of

philosophical
reflections

Monk
reflected
for
a
moment
,
and
then
replied
gayly
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
let
us
speak
a
little
of

I
believe

an
audience
of

The
king
,
during
this
discussion
so
characteristic
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
had
returned
to
the
center
of
the
gallery
.
``

he
in

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
bowed
lower
than
before
.
I
said
so

<PROPER_NOUN>

During
this

<PROPER_NOUN>
took
the

of

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
It

<UNK>

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
himself
,
whilst
his
friend
,
on
his
knees
,
received
the
eminent
order
which
the
king
conferred
on
him
-
``
it
is
almost
incredible
that
I
have
always
seen
<UNK>
of
prosperity
fall
upon
all
who
surrounded
me

not

ever
reached

he
to

then
stopping
with
a
smile
,
``

you
will
be

make
you
viceroy

of

His
heart
,
however
,
had
been
moved
by
this
last
favor

Oh
!

What

The
emotions
of
the

worn

out

That

Monk
colored
in
his
turn

The
eyes
of

regained
their
gayety
and
their
brilliancy

am
richer

certainly

now
that

almost

he
is
worth

not

pay

But
if
the
general
will
have
the
kindness
to
deliver
me
his
sword
,
I
shall
consider
myself
paid

there
is
nothing

``
Upon

he
drew
his

In

<PROPER_NOUN>
broke
into
<UNK>
laughter
.
is
he
not

And
going
to
the
table
,
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
an

upon

treasurer
for

when

were
out

He
had
then
the
satisfaction

exchange

covered

for

D'Artagnan
shut
himself
up
,
ate
no
dinner
,
closed
his
door
to
everybody
,
and
,
with
a
lighted
lamp
,
and
a
loaded

on

he
watched
all
night
,
<UNK>
upon
the

chatting

with
the

upon

developed

on

surface

Of
middle
height

rather
lean

he
had
deep-set

a

appearance

his
hair
was
coarse

black

thin

which

the

made

take

Such

This

been

great

so

Of

<PROPER_NOUN>
held
the

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
commanded

turned

May

Whilst

with
perfectly

he
snatched
the

from

desired

down

The

heaved

looked

wonder

At

he
was
enabled

convince
himself
of
the

the

drew

Their

no

Every

it

the

Perhaps
there
he
could
embark
;
if

crossing

he

to

<PROPER_NOUN>
sought

The

This

<PROPER_NOUN>
called

I

do

The

some

But
when

the

cast

from

and
upon

was
nothing

The

were
added

bacon

<PROPER_NOUN>
and
his

bowed

shared
the

And
the

the

rummaged
in

drew
out
a

His
attention

therefore

once
awakened
on

he
surrounded
himself
with

circumspection

gave
him
a

continued
the
poet
.

The

sent
for

immediately
attended

he
;

And

the

left

like

had
learnt

The

got
into
his

in

courtyard

with
his
lackey

Only
he
took
such
notice

The
musketeer
<UNK>
all

whom
he
found
cunning

mistrustful

devoted

soul
,
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
musketeer
then
made
some
inquiries
concerning
the
salt-mines
,
and
took
the
road
to
the
marshes
,
leaving
the
sea
on
his

penetrating
into

a

the

If

turned
round

the

he
saw

asked
the

There

<NUMBER>

''
replied
the
fisherman
,
proudly
.
``
His
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
right
enough
.
''
It
was
not
,
then
,
till
after
standing
several
minutes
on
the
shore
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
saw
upon
the
port
,
but
more
particularly
in
the
interior
of
the
isle
,
an
immense
number
of
workmen
in
motion
.
Everywhere
was
to
be
seen
an
activity
equal
to
that
which
<PROPER_NOUN>
observed
on
his
landing
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
And
his
very
first
glance
fell
on
certain
movements
of
earth
about
which
the
eye
of
a
soldier
could
not
be
mistaken
.
By
the
activity
displayed
in
these
works
,
already
so
far
advanced
,
they
might
be
considered
as
finished
:
they
were
not
yet
furnished
with
their
<UNK>
,
but
the
<UNK>
had
their
<UNK>
and
their
<UNK>
all
prepared
;
the
earth
,
beaten
carefully
,
was
<UNK>
;
and
supposing
the
artillery
to
be
on
the
island
,
in
less
than
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
days
the
port
might
be
completely
armed
.
It
did
not
take
long
to
make
<PROPER_NOUN>
perceive
the
superiority
of
such
a
system
,
which
gives
no
advantage
to
cannon
.
With
an
air
of
simple
curiosity
D'Artagnan
asked
if
he
might
be
permitted
to
cross
the
bridge
,
and
he
was
told
that
no
order
prevented
it
.
This
engineer
,
who
by
his
evident
importance
first
attracted
the
attention
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
wore
a
justaucorps
,
which
,
from
its
<UNK>
was
scarcely
in
harmony
with
the
work
he
was
employed
in
,
that
rather
<UNK>
the
costume
of
a
<UNK>
than
of
a
noble
.
At
that
moment
the
man
with
the
feathers
ceased
to
gesticulate
,
and
,
with
his
hands
placed
upon
his
knees
,
was
following
,
<UNK>
,
the
effort
of
<NUMBER>
workmen
to
raise
a
block
of
<UNK>
stone
to
the
top
of
a
piece
of
timber
destined
to
support
that
stone
,
so
that
the
cord
of
the
<UNK>
might
be
passed
under
it
.
Every
time
,
the
stone
,
abandoned
by
them
,
sunk
deeper
into
the
damp
earth
,
which
rendered
the
operation
more
and
more
difficult
.
Then
he
drew
himself
up
.
Have
I
to
do
with
men
of
straw
?
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
will
he
pretend
to
raise
that
rock
?
The
workman
who
held
the
plank
profited
by
the
space
thus
given
him
,
and
slipped
the
<UNK>
under
the
stone
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
''
On
his
part
,
the
man
with
the
feathers
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
disguised
lieutenant
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
metamorphosis
,
recognized
him
.
said
he
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
interest
of
the
particular
secret
of
each
struck
them
both
at
the
same
instant
.
``
What
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
brings

to

asked
he
of

``

``

This

flattering

was

did
not

satisfy
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``

appeared

give

up

The

raised
my

I
embarked
in

,
without
dreaming
that

:
I
came

I

raised

Whilst

disguised
an

a

approached

``

At

close

On

had

the

He

In

He

At

said

whether

After

In

instead

she
ran
and
embraced

asked

of

murmured
Malicorne
as
he
descended
the
stairs
,
-
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
!
We
will
then
enter
into
some
details
concerning
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
le
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
had
,
as
the
companion
of
his
<UNK>
,
this
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
a
poor
gentleman
,
<UNK>
,
of
the
house
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
But
this
was
the
way
this
system
of
<UNK>
was
paid
for
:
instead
of
wearing
such
mean
<UNK>
as
his
paternal
fortunes
entitled
him
to
,
he
was
able
to
appear
brilliant
,
superb
,
like
a
young
noble
of
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
livres
a
year
.
<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
times
every
year
he
drained
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
when
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
thoroughly
drained
,
when
he
had
turned
out
his
pockets
and
his
purse
before
him
,
when
he
declared
that
it
would
be
at
least
a
fortnight
before
paternal
munificence
would
<UNK>
those
pockets
and
that
purse
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
lost
all
his
energy
,
he
went
to
bed
,
remained
there
,
ate
nothing
and
sold
his
handsome
clothes
,
under
the
pretense
that
,
remaining
in
bed
,
he
did
not
want
them
.
Among
the
admirers
of
these
splendid
<UNK>
,
our
friend
Malicorne
was
conspicuous
;
he
was
the
son
of
a
syndic
of
the
city
,
of
whom
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
always
needy
as
a
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
often
borrowed
money
at
enormous
interest
.
Malicorne
had
determined
to
rise
,
at
whatever
price
it
might
cost
,
and
for
this
,
at
whatever
price
it
did
cost
,
he
had
given
himself
a
mistress
and
a
friend
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
cost
-
money
lent
,
never
returned
-
from
<NUMBER>
to
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
livres
per
annum
.
He
employed
a
mode
of
proceeding
,
upon
which
he
preserved
the
most
profound
secrecy
,
and
which
consisted
in
advancing
to
himself
from
the
coffers
of
the
syndic
,
half
a
dozen
year
's
profits
,
that
is
to
say
,
<NUMBER>
<NUMBER>
livres
,
swearing
to
himself
-
observe
,
quite
to
himself
-
to
repay
this
deficiency
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
should
present
itself
.
Then
,
when
once
an
<UNK>
of
this
post
,
he
would
marry
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
would
be
maid
of
honor
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
The
<UNK>
plan
of
Malicorne
-
for
we
may
well
suppose
that
the
combinations
of
a
mind
as
active
as
his
were
not
confined
to
the
present
,
but
extended
to
the
future
-
the
<UNK>
plan
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
we
say
,
was
this
:
-
To
obtain
entrance
into
the
household
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
for
a
woman
devoted
to
himself
,
who
was
intelligent
,
young
,
handsome
,
and
<UNK>
;
to
learn
,
by
means
of
this
woman
,
all
the
feminine
secrets
of
the
young
household
,
whilst
he
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
and
his
friend
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
should
,
between
them
,
know
all
the
<UNK>
secrets
of
the
young
community
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
this
plan
presented
itself
bristling
with
difficulties
:
but
the
greatest
of
all
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
herself
.
<UNK>
with
desire
,
when
she
advanced
to
tempt
him
,
he
had
the
art
to
appear
ice
,
persuaded
that
if
he
opened
his
arms
,
she
would
run
away
laughing
at
him
.
But
what
made
<PROPER_NOUN>
hold
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
in
an
<UNK>
fashion
,
was
that
Malicorne
always
came
<UNK>
full
of
fresh
news
from
the
court
and
the
city
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
always
brought
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
fashion
,
a
secret
,
or
a
perfume
;
that
Malicorne
never
asked
for
a
meeting
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
required
to
be
supplicated
to
receive
the
favors
he
burned
to
obtain
.
As
to
the
good
man
,
Malicorne
-
we
speak
of
the
syndic
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
-
he
did
not
see
more
clearly
into
the
present
than
others
did
into
the
future
;
and
had
no
suspicion
as
he
walked
,
every
day
,
between
<NUMBER>
and
<NUMBER>
o'clock
,
after
his
dinner
,
upon
the
Place
<UNK>
,
in
his
gray
coat
,
cut
after
the
fashion
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
He
had
,
a
fortnight
before
extorted
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
de
<PROPER_NOUN>
a
<NUMBER>
pistoles
,
all
he
had
,
to
assist
in
<UNK>
him
properly
to
go
and
meet
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
her
arrival
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
No
more
fire
,
no
more
<UNK>
,
no
more
<UNK>
,
nothing
but
sleep
to
take
the
place
of
repasts
,
companies
and
balls
.
``
Eh
!
you
are
very
polite
!
''
``
Oh

Malicorne
pretended
to
be
mistaken
,
and
gave
him
his

``
What

be
done
for
it
?

made

The

bent
themselves
to

bounded

a

more

in

the

induced

to-day

even
for

In

<UNK>
beneath

had

conversing

The

overheard
this

turned
suddenly
pale

and
,
letting
his
hands
fall
in
great
discouragement
by

drew
aside

mingling
in

sigh
his

<PROPER_NOUN>

on
the

paler
still
perhaps
from
happiness

than
his

from
anger

seated
himself
tremblingly
next
the

whose
silken
robe
,
as
it
lightly
touched
him
,
caused
a
tremor

mingled
regret

to
pass
through
his

And
saying
this

he
presented
his

to

<PROPER_NOUN>
with
such
marked
deference
,
and
at
the

time
with
a
nobleness
of
mien
so
intrepid
,
that
a
murmur
of
admiration
rose
from
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whilst
a
groan
of
despair
escaped
from
<PROPER_NOUN>
's
lips
.
The
smiling
hills
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
appeared
in
full
view
with
their
numerous
white
houses
rendered
more
conspicuous
by
the
bright
green
of
the

the
clear
blue
sky

The
queen-mother
,
with
greater
experience

calmer
judgment
,
perceived
the
exact
position

affairs

as
she
discerned
its

was
prepared

meet
it

whenever

Not

detail
escaped

he
heard
both

entreaty

the

reply
;

remarked

retire

heard
his

saw

pass
his

across

As
the

of
<PROPER_NOUN>
gave
his
commands

a

was
slowly
lowered
from

``
My

she
said

``

He
had
thought
he

be

keep
near

during
the
passage

,
by

the

The

pretended
not

notice
him
,
while
the
queen
turned
aside
her
head
,
and
the
admiral
laughed
outright
,
at
the
sound
of

seemed
ready

spring
upon
him

Saying
this

he
looked
towards

who
cast
down
her
eyes

``
His
grace

not
be

said
the
admiral
aloud
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
In
very
anguish
of
mind
,
he
sank
down
in
the
boat
,
burying
his
hands
in
his
hair
,
whilst
the
boat

impelled
by
the
exertions
of
the
merry
sailors

flew
over
the

It
was
followed
by
another

filled
with
officers

courtiers

and
zealous
friends

<UNK>
of
gay
music
greeted
her
arrival

and
accompanied

every

took

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
not

however

the

on

and
<NUMBER>
minutes
afterwards
they
were
within

The

was
surrounded
by

who
had
been
given

mounted

before

The

passage
which
led
to

,
and
which
was
not
inclosed
by

resembling

the

opened
towards

At

the

young

appeared
at

whose

richness

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
<UNK>
infuriated
,
raised
his
whip
;
but
his
arm
was
seized
by
a
couple
of
officers

``
What
is
the

''
Probably
the
personal
appearance
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
was
dressed
very
plainly
,
did
not
inspire
him
with
much
respect

for

replied
disdainfully
,
``
Who

inquired
<PROPER_NOUN>

``
On

exasperated

<PROPER_NOUN>
arrived
at

he
pushed
through

separated

followed

arrived

came
up
from

<PROPER_NOUN>

``
Because

``
Most

exclaimed

,
in
so
violent

At

I

with
still

I

observing

at

I
concluded

become
paler

around

``

putting

``
Do

And
he
grasped
a
beautiful
dagger
,
the
handle
of
which
was
inlaid
with
precious
stones
;
and
which
he
half
drew
from
his
breast

Then
suddenly
,
he
said
,
``

in

at

he

returned

From

After

over

Yes

pronounced

The

was
clear

the

reclined

looking

It
seemed

departure
had
shed
a
balm
on

hearts
of
the
previous
evening

The

spirits

divided
her
attention
between

who
was

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
quietly
<UNK>
her
about

enormous

and
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
exhibited
an

delight

Can

tell

what
direction
the

in
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
which
<UNK>
mighty
vessels
to
and
fro
,
carry
such
sighs
as
these
.
He
could
hardly
yet
despair
,
but
he
was
strong
enough
to
impose
silence
upon
the
tumultuous
<UNK>
of
his
heart
.
The
queens
,
<UNK>
and
ceremonious

were
softened

could
not
restrain

flashed
like

From

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
had
once
looked

this

fearful
to
disgust
the

such
a

displeased

The

hardly
paid
any
attention
to
her
departure

the

indisposition

The
consequence
of
these
blushes

of
these
<UNK>
sighs
,
and
of
this
royal
agitation

was

that

her

she
tremblingly
followed
the

without
thinking
of
taking
the
gloves
,
which
court
etiquette
required
her

different

<PROPER_NOUN>

hurried
his
departure
,
so
that
the
greater
part
of
his
adieux
were
very
hastily
made

Such
of
his

he
had
been
able
to
confide
,
had
,
in
their
character
of
wits
,
rallied
him
upon
the
duke

superiority
.
The
duke
received
his
adversary
as
he
would
have
done
an
intimate
acquaintance
,
made
room
beside
him
on
the

seat

offered
him
refreshments

and
spread
over
his
knees
the
<UNK>
cloak
that
had
been
thrown
on
the
front
seat

The

somewhat
resembled
the

which
folds
<PROPER_NOUN>
a

beneath

the

rage
more
furiously
.
The

had
been
embarked
,
having
been
hoisted
from
the
boat
upon
the
deck
in
baskets
expressly
made
for

in

a

that
their

desired
the

that

as
the

promised
a
splendid
sunset

he
did
not

go
on

until
<UNK>
,
and
would
avail
himself
of
the
evening
to
enjoy
a

The
sea
was
gilded
with
the

and
upon
the
crest
of
every
sparkling
wave
danced
a

of
light

The

The

was
fast

they
attacked

almost
instinctively

<UNK>
his

with

the

wounded

his

gave
way
beneath

and
leaving
his

still
fixed
in

arm

he
fell
into
the
water

was
soon
<UNK>
with
a

that

from

``

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

in
a
voice
choked
by
the
blood

rushed
from

Then
falling
down
again

said
,
``

The
boat
flew
over
the
waves

but
the
sea
rose
faster
than
the
boat
could
approach
.
He
had
hardly
gone
<NUMBER>
paces
,
when
a
second
wave
,
rushing
onwards
higher

more
furious
and
menacing
than
the

,
struck
him
at
the
height
of
his
chest
,
threw
him
over
and
buried
him
beneath
the
water

Their
terror
was
extreme
when
they
observed
how
their

became
covered
with
blood
,
in
proportion
as
the

they

The

had
by

reached

the

steward
leaped
into
the
sea
,
and
approached
the
marquis

who
no

showed
any

A

on

by
the

The

handed
it

The

critical

added

insulted

where

As

there
awaited

A

hidden
in

opened
noiselessly

a

in

silently
advanced

stood
behind
the

on

After

time
the

arranged
his

then
looked
with
great
complacency

throwing

The

such

at

pitied

by

the

He
felt
in

drew
from

opened

At

When
the
landlady
made
her
appearance
she
expressed
much
astonishment
at
seeing

.
``
<UNK>

The

D'Artagnan
was
on

He
ran
up
the
steps

entered
the

,
and
addressing
a

who
was
sweeping
the

,
asked
him

he
is

It
was
not
difficult
to
understand
that
he
had
gained
the
crown
of
his
ambition
and
that
the
<UNK>
wand
he
<UNK>

in
his

threw

or
did
not

into

It
was
to
this

he
performed
from

some
of
those

the

generally

attended

He
turned

returned

<PROPER_NOUN>
perceived
that
he
was
<UNK>
prudence
with
respect
to
himself
.
Then
<PROPER_NOUN>
rushed
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
arrived
in
time
to
see
<PROPER_NOUN>
turn
down
the

and
enter

in
the

,
a
respectable

house
;
and
this
D'Artagnan
felt
no

was
the
habitation
of
the
worthy

.
He
perceived
in
the
tavern
a
<UNK>
boy
between
<NUMBER>

<NUMBER>
years
of
age
whom
he
fancied
he
had
seen
not

Almost
immediately
<PROPER_NOUN>
came
downstairs

cried
the

his

sparkling
with
joy

with

Scarcely

The
child
put
the
piece
of
money
into
his
pocket

``

dost

Now
I
thought
that

out

<PROPER_NOUN>
introduced
him
in

He
began
his

by
breakfasting

a

beginning
when
<NUMBER>
wants

employ

but
an

precaution
when
<NUMBER>
wants

work
the

and
about

he

A

seeing

he
beckoned
to

were
drinking

out

<PROPER_NOUN>
also
was
lost
in
thought

the
subject

their
reflections
was
not
the

.
She

remain
half-way
upon
the

toward
fulfilment

expectations
.

``

The
obscurity
was
broken
only
now
and
then
by
the
still
darker
lines
of
the
roofs
of
houses
.
D'Artagnan
looked
attentively
at
the
building
.
In
about

<PROPER_NOUN>
returned

that

on

resumed

<PROPER_NOUN>
was
acquainted

having
gone
thither
with

on

was

now
called

and
resided
on

Accordingly

on

found

breakfast
waiting

was

sang
on

shone
through

to

thought

was
happy

arriving
at

extremity

found
himself
overlooking
a
beautiful
valley
,
in
which
,
at
the
foot
of
a
charming

lake
,
stood
several
scattered
houses
,
which
,
humble
in
their
aspect

and
covered

some
with
tiles

others
with

seemed

in

who
,
recognizing
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
acting
very
differently
from
the
hypocrite
<PROPER_NOUN>

slipped
off
his
horse
and
approached
the
officer
with
his

off

so
that
the

turned
toward

eclipsed

And
mounting

rode
off
down
the
avenue
on

grass
at
a
hand
gallop

I
see
nothing

faces
a

broad

me
that

that

instead

are
covered
with
red

green
ribbons
as
on

days

alighted
as

saw

giant
on

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
at
the

wiped

changed

D'Artagnan
retired
to
bed
-
not
to
sleep
,
but
to
think
over
all
he
had
heard
that
evening
.
Who
was
the
youth
he
had
adopted
and
who
bore
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
him
?
He
could
not
help
thinking
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
whom
he
had
seen
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
could
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
have
forestalled

with

<UNK>
to
seek
an
explanation

all
these

on
the

,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
in
spite
of
his
fatigue
,
prepared
for
an
attack
and
determined
that
it
should
take
place
after
breakfast
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
if
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
deemed
him
superior
to
them
in
the
arts
of
diplomacy

they
would
like
him
all
the

for
it
;
but
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
on
the
contrary
,
would
despise
him
.
There
reigned
a
perfect
stillness
in
the
house
.
``
He
is
walking
about
and
thinking

''
thought
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
``

of

He

not

The

was
opening

thought
the

The

followed
them
with
his

his

resting
on
the
shoulders
of
the
youth
,
whose
height
was
almost
equal
to
his

as

he

touched
the

point

Meantime

<PROPER_NOUN>
redoubled

<UNK>
the

even
in

that

opened

to
inhale
better
the

deigned
to

ended
by
a

so
violent

became

eventually
,
as

the

After

in
common

bent

the

had
was

day
when

to
efface

The

thought
proper

drawing
such

he
should
be
obliged
to
deprive
him

His

Having
been

up

down

he

began
without

perform

Then
the

put

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
made
violent
signs
that
it
was
,
by
raising

lowering
his

-
there
was
a
profound
silence
in
the
room

addressed

A

afterward
the

going

found
<NUMBER>
rows
of
trees
about
the
size

planted
by

he
asked
what
they
were
for
and
was
told
that
they
were
to
shade
him
from
the
sun
on
some
future
day
.
He
assembled
his
keepers
,
and
notwithstanding
his
well-known
difficulty
of
utterance
,
addressed
them
as
follows
:
``

when

Now
,
although

appreciated

as
of

the

of
being

the

<PROPER_NOUN>
thereupon
presented
himself
with

exterior
at

donjon

``

added

<PROPER_NOUN>

become
a

seemed
to
push
time
before
him
and
sought
most
eagerly
to
hasten
the
hour

action

It
may
be
observed
that
there
was
a

proportion
in
his
sentiments
toward
the
governor

the

is
the

of

human
mind

was
the
sullen
face
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
for
whom
he
had
at
first
conceived
such
a
hatred
and
who
now
was
all
his

And
so
the
good
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
made
a
festivity
of
the
little
supper
with
his
prisoner
.
He
therefore
looked
forward
to
<NUMBER>
o'clock
with
as
much
impatience
as

<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>

watered

he
returned
to

chamber
rubbing
his

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
going
in
advance
,
followed
the
course
which
they
were
to
take
in
the
evening

It

the

<NUMBER>
of

guards

who
were
constantly

assisted

Upon

appeared
the

with

arms
on
it
,
and
seemingly
cooked
to
a
turn

as
far
as

could
judge
by

illuminated

One

<UNK>
the

replied

<PROPER_NOUN>

with

the

,
``

<PROPER_NOUN>
placed
the
pie
before

who
took

<PROPER_NOUN>

And
instantly
,
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
sitting
upon

commenced

The

uttered
a

<PROPER_NOUN>
did
not
give

on

embroidered

But
to

D'Artagnan
remained

reaching

<PROPER_NOUN>
sent

enter

showed
no

his
countenance

his

<UNK>
with
joy

<PROPER_NOUN>
opened

In

a

heard
in

ante-chamber

at

the
door

the

was
burst

a

covered

rushed

exclaiming

barking

there

events

we
shall
see
that
this

slight

came
near

the

From
the
top
of
an
eminence
D'Artagnan
perceived
a
group

people
collected
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
,
in
front
of
that
part
of
the
donjon
which
looks
toward

They
looked
at
the
cord

still
hanging
from
the
loophole
and
broken
at
about
<NUMBER>
feet
from
the
ground
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
went
straight
to
the
sergeant
.
``
Yes

my

unfortunately

they
are

<PROPER_NOUN>

looking
at

``
How

a

have
they

``
Very

and
now
in

they
set
out

``
Speak

``
Ah

And
by

out

<PROPER_NOUN>
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
made
a
sign
to
his
escort
and
started
.
It
was
necessary
to
compel
him
to
open
it
,
as
the
sergeant
had
been
compelled
to
speak
,
and
this
took
another
<NUMBER>
minutes
.
``
If

we
<NUMBER>
arrive

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
it

set
out

horse
sank

thy

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
Good

''
``
Well

''
They
went
on
through
the
darkness
,
silent
as
phantoms
;
they
saw
a
light
<UNK>
in
the
midst
of
some
trees
.
D'Artagnan
approached
quickly
,
making
a

to
his

to
remain
a

``
Yes

And
he
took
hold

<NUMBER>
within
his

;
his

did
the

A

appeared

just

mount

cried
the

;

The

and
then

ere
the

could
oppose
his

Grimaud
seized
a

forced
the

toward
an

Perhaps

would
have
sought

by

seen
any

The

searched
his

with
the

peculiar
to
those

are
about

have
no

eagerly
replied
the

who
doubtless
feared
that
the

take
from
him
the

could
claim

the

who

sitting
on
the

began
to
be

Oh

At

through
the

they
showed

a

Whilst

the

re-entered

followed
not

by

by

the

upon

on

the

This

it

<UNK>
by

he

concentrated
his

he

seated

The

was

therefore
,
contrary

gloomy
and
anxious
,
when
an
officer
entered
and
announced
to

de

that
some
<NUMBER>
wished
to
see
him

The
prince
leaped
to
his
feet
,
extending
his
hand
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
sound
,
there
was
no
mistaking
it
-
it
was
the
noise
of
cannon
.
``
What
!
''
``
Speak

said
the

,
saluting
them
;
``

He

<UNK>
to
the

what

At

the
prince
,
having
in
mind
the
direction
whence
came
the
sound
of
cannon
,
had
understood
everything
.
Was
it
an
entire
army
?
The
prince
turned
and
seemed
to
cover
the
young
man
with
a
single
glance
;
he
smiled
on
perceiving
that
he
was
a
child
hardly
<NUMBER>
years
old

cried
the
prince
.
The
old
marshal
turned
toward
the
viscount
,
grateful
for
that
praise
of
his
son
,
whilst
the
prince
exclaimed
:
``
The

right

But
here
is
the
letter

Since

been
taken
he
had
not
uttered
a

so
that
it
was
not
known
to
what
country
he
belonged

The
prisoner
muttered
a

words
in
a
foreign
tongue
.
Do
you
speak

,
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

``
What

that

''
``
Yes

my
lord

<PROPER_NOUN>
began
the
examination
,
but
the
result
justified
his
opinion
.
The
prisoner
started
and
bit
his
lips
.
Therefore
,
he
knew
nothing
either
of
the
enemy

purpose

The

``

said
the

I
have

even

<NUMBER>
would
have
said
that
his
gaze
could
pierce
the
branches

trees
which
limited
his
horizon

The
report

Spanish
cruelty
had
gone
out
and
every

frightened

The
peasant
started
off
,
running
before
the
prince
's
horse
;
then
,
a
<NUMBER>
steps
from
the
village
,
he
took
a
narrow
road
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
.
He
then
began
to
ascend
the
path
.
In
a

the
plan
of
the
battle
which
on
the
following
day
was
to
save
<PROPER_NOUN>
the
second

unrolled
in

A
portion
of
the
troops
had
already
arrived
and
the
remainder
was
expected
from
moment

The
prince
awaited
him
there

<UNK>
were
given

no

sounded

Presently
the
army
came
in
sight
of

<NUMBER>
or
<NUMBER>
houses
were
in
flames
and
a
dull
noise
was
heard
which
indicated
what
suffering

endured
by
a

taken
by
assault
.
Finally
,
the
prince
led
the
right
wing
,
resting
on

At
<NUMBER>
o'clock
every
<NUMBER>
was
in
his
appointed
position

at
half-past
<NUMBER>
the
prince
visited
the
posts
and
gave
his

orders
for
the

day
.
Although
the
day
had
been
<UNK>
,
neither

inclined
to
sleep

Some
sentiment
of
this
kind
must
have
been
cherished
by
each

these

friends

for
each

sat
down

heard

bent
so
forward
over

that
one
might
have
supposed
he
was
about
to
precipitate

<PROPER_NOUN>

who

hopeless

At
this
moment
they
were
hailed
by
a
voice
from
the
sloop
and
a
few
seconds
later
men
,
servants
and
baggage
were
aboard

The
bustle
which
had
been
observed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
for
which
she
had
vainly
sought
to

taken

as
well

from

upon

arches
of

<PROPER_NOUN>

And
this
all
knew
so
well
that
it
was
a
double
victory
for
the
court
,
a
victory
at
home
and
abroad
;
so
that
even
when
the
young
king
learned
the
news
he
exclaimed
,
``
Ah

gentlemen

parliament

we
shall
see
what

will
say
now

The
following
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
then
,
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
arose
with
joy
;
at

period
a

was
a
grand
affair
;
this
kind

ceremony
had
not

been
abused

it
produced
a

Nevertheless

at

o'clock
in
the
morning
the
regiment
of
the
queen

guards
,
commanded
by

under

was
his

marched
publicly

preceded

<UNK>
off
from

a
manoeuvre
which
the
<PROPER_NOUN_PLURAL>
witnessed
tranquilly
,
delighted
as
they
were
with
military
music
and
brilliant
uniforms
.
In
consequence
he
took
to
his
heels
,
arrived
breathlessly
at
the
councillor
's
door
,
and
knocked
violently
.
``

have
been

said

<PROPER_NOUN>
heard
the
scream
of
the
young

,
enchanted
with
this
excess
of
zeal

came
down
to
the

working

on

``
On

The
councillor
placed
himself
at
the
window
;
the
street
was
completely
deserted
,
but
in
the
distance
was
heard
,
like
the
noise

tide
rushing
in

increasing
now
around

looked
on

admiration

ceremony

so

neither

nor

taken

at

A

so
peacefully
assembled
there

not

approached

cried

``

At

fired

passed
through

and
broke
the

continued

produced

The

were
seen

the

dragging

there
the

The

proceeded
onward
to
the

there
he

Louvieres
recognized

these

The

seemed

hurled

Then
a

from

as

All
fell
to

A

placed

drawing
his

he
said

``
We

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
;
and
the
poor
coachman
was
conducted
to
a
closet

the
windows
of
which
were
barred
and
which
looked
very
much
like
a

added
he

seriously
,
``

Midnight
struck
.
As
we
said
before
,
by
<NUMBER>
o'clock
almost
all
the
guests
had
dispersed
;
those

were

``

the

,
``
it
is
time
for

go
to

``
You
are
right

the

the

,
``

I
have

The
queen
then
gave
her
orders
,
spoke
of
a
banquet
which
the

to
give
to

another

where
she
intended

and
gave
her
commands
to

valet
to
accompany
her

It
was
at
this

D'Artagnan
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
,
in
the
coadjutor

carriage
,
and
a

seconds
later
the

out

the

shut
after

``

she
said

``

``
But
in

The
young

was
already
dressed
,
with
the
exception
of
his
shoes
and
doublet
;
he
had
allowed
himself

be
dressed

in
great
astonishment

overwhelming
<UNK>
with
questions

who
replied
only
in

``

As
soon
as
the

perceived
the
queen
he
escaped
from

ran
to
meet
her
.
The
young
king
looked
at
the
officer
with
his
<UNK>
eye
,

repeated
:

At

startled

replied

,
<UNK>
both
at

his

ear

,
as
he
rapidly
left
the

The

half
dressed

the

remained
each
in

almost
in

For

D'Artagnan
thought

put

recognized

The

in

remained
facing

without
uttering

the

standing

<PROPER_NOUN>
half
out

the

raised

again
at

instead

the

became

he
was
an

The

drew
his

and
broke
it
on

Turning
back
again

he
said

At

couriers
started
in

The

made
a

Whether

not

<PROPER_NOUN>
did

``

He
threw
himself
at

and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
<PROPER_NOUN>
general
,
who
did

this

he
took
his

kissed

The
order
given
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
the
sergeant
had
been
heard
by
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
accordingly
,
by
an
expressive
glance
,
warned
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
<PROPER_NOUN>
to
exercise
extreme
caution
.
<PROPER_NOUN>
remained
glued
to
the
door
,
awaiting
the
explanation
of
this
strange
occurrence
.
The
windows
on
the
ground
floor
,
according
to
a
custom
in
provincial
villages
,
were
barred
,
so
that
they
strongly
resembled
the
windows
of
a
prison
.
``
We
must
first
see
what
the
sergeant
wishes

do

replied
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
There
could
be
no
fault
to
find
with
this
arrangement

on

it
seemed
to
be
a
delicate
attention

to
be
gratefully
received
;
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
therefore
,
thanked
the
man
and
gave

a

to
drink
to

health
.
``
What

``
<UNK>
look
black

D'Artagnan
looked
at
Porthos
with
that
air
of
wonder
which
a
cunning

can
not
help
feeling
at
<UNK>
of
<UNK>
stupidity

'T
is
easily
guessed
.
``
And
whom
I
advised

said
<PROPER_NOUN>

There

a

on

once

D'Artagnan

<PROPER_NOUN>
blushed
,
but
with
pleasure
rather
than
with
confusion
;
and
yet
,
bowing
his
head
,
as

humiliated

he
said
:

saw
a

coming
toward

at

This
movement
was
observed
by
<PROPER_NOUN>

The
blood
mounted
to
his

his
eyes
became
dim
;
he
saw
from
what

the

put

<PROPER_NOUN>
stopped
short

recoiled

he
felt

disappeared

struck

At

out

placed

<PROPER_NOUN>
clasped

amazed

stupefied
to
find

these

,
without

imposed

thus
combated

The

looked
at

with
astonishment
.
``
I

said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

I
understand

The

satisfied
the

that

expected

He
could

Parry

odious

sought

The

<PROPER_NOUN>
started

<PROPER_NOUN>
withdrew

Parry
closed

approaching
the

his

radiant
with
joy
:

he

Parry
was
not

Through

the

,
hidden
by

Juxon
consented
the

to
take
him
with
him
,
as
he
would
require
an
assistant
priest
in
case
the

should
wish

Nothing
was
changed
.
The
bishop
affected
to
speak
in
a
loud
voice
,
before
every

of
their
previous
interview
.
As
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
:
``
<PROPER_NOUN>

''
said
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
speaking
rapidly
,
``

Meanwhile
,
the
<UNK>
underneath
was
heard
working
away
incessantly
,
when
suddenly
an
unexpected
noise
resounded
in
the
passage
.
All
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
,
which
opened
slowly
and
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
.
Juxon
replied
with
a
sign
which
meant
that
he
knew
no
more
than
<PROPER_NOUN>
about
it
.
``
Then

But
<PROPER_NOUN>
was
livid
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
officer
.
Will
this
be
permitted
me

my

he
cried
,
seizing
<PROPER_NOUN>

``

<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``

he
added
to
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
had
moved
to
leave
the
room
.
The
mob
had
already
assembled
when
the
confession
terminated
.
He
turned
to
brush
away
a
tear
,
and
then
,
summoning
up
all
his
firmness
,
drew
his
daughter
toward
him
,
recommending
her
to
be
pious
and
resigned
.
Do

replied
the

``
Oh

Take

Juxon

their

''
A
deathlike
silence
reigned
in
the
room
above
.
``
What
is
the
matter
,
then
?
''
What
is
he
looking
at
?
The
sound
of
heavy
steps
was
heard
above
his
head
.
It
was
the
king
speaking
on
the
scaffold
.
Behind
him
,
pale
indeed
,
but
marching
with
a
firm
step
,
was
<PROPER_NOUN>
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
who
advanced
between
<NUMBER>
priests
,
followed
by
a

superior
officers
appointed

execution
and
attended
by
<NUMBER>
<UNK>
of
partisans
who
took
their
places
on
opposite
sides
of
the
scaffold
.
But
they
could
discern
nothing
but
a
man
of
middle
height
,
dressed
in
black
,
apparently
of
a
certain
age
,
for
the
end
of
a
gray
beard
peeped
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
mask
that
hid
his
features
.
Is
it
possible
that
<PROPER_NOUN>
has
abandoned
His

on
earth
and
left
him
to
die
thus
<UNK>
?
``
Do
not
touch
the
axe
,
''
said
the
king
,
and
resumed
his
speech
.
``
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
''
said
he
to
the
priest
,
``
I
shall
keep
this
cross

<NUMBER>
by
<NUMBER>
he
undid
the

of
his

,
took
it
off
and
deposited
it
by
the
side
of
his
hat
.
``
Will
these
be
in
your

''
But
after
the
searching
look
of
the
king
he
encountered
the
burning
eyes
of
<PROPER_NOUN>
.
``
It
is
the
usual
block

''
answered
the
man
in
the
mask
.
There
was
something
so
strange
in
these
<NUMBER>
words
that
everybody
,
except
the
king
,
shuddered
.
``
When
I
shall
lay
my

on
the
block

say
`
Remember

He
looked
at
<PROPER_NOUN>
and
made
a
special
sign
to
him
with
his
head
.
Then
he
knelt
down
,
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
,
and
lowering
his
face
to
the
planks
,
as
if
he
would
have
kissed
them
,
said
in
a
low
tone
,
in
<PROPER_NOUN>
,
``
Comte

He
had
scarcely
uttered
the

when
a
heavy
blow
shook
the
scaffold
and
where
<PROPER_NOUN>
stood
immovable
a
warm
drop
fell
upon
his
brow

Then
as
the
crowd
gradually
dispersed
he
leaped
down
,
crept
from
behind
the
drapery
,
glided
between
<NUMBER>
horses
,
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
inn

But
at
the

he
uttered
the

roused
himself
from
the
kind
of
lethargy
in
which
he
had
sunk

``

drawing

Just

a

rode
up

This

<UNK>
<PROPER_NOUN>
to

as
the
impression
produced

foremost
in

had
been
very

he
contented

So
I
have
a

when

``
You
did
not

answered
a

from

added

offering

his

I
saw

return

change

after

at

This

produced
quite

Toward

reached

The

refused

at

with
anxiety

A

showed
